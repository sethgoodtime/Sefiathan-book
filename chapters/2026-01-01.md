Day 1: The Ugly Bird

Sefiathan Murrgood woke to the taste of copper and regret.

The sun had not yet crested the Thornspire Mountains, but light enough filtered through the canopy above to illuminate his mistake: he lay in a hollow between gnarled roots, his traveling cloak soaked through with dew and something that smelled distinctly of fermented snapberry wine. His head throbbed with each heartbeat, a rhythm of poor choices.

He was twenty-seven years old, and he was nothing.

Not a wizard, though his mother had been. Not a warrior, though his father had tried. Not fae, though he'd been told his grandmother carried their blood. Just Sefiathan Murrgood, possessing no particular talent, no defining feature, no power worth naming. A man shaped like a question mark in a world that demanded declarations.

He'd left Millhaven three days ago with a promise whispered to himself in the dark: one year. Three hundred and sixty-five days to find whatever spark lived inside him, or accept that perhaps there was nothing to find at all. A pilgrimage of betterment, he'd called it. His sister had called it running away.

Maybe they were both right.

Sefiathan pushed himself upright, wincing as his spine protested. Bits of bark clung to his hair. His pack lay a few feet away, contents scattered—a half-empty waterskin, a journal with water-stained pages, a knife that had been his father's, and three copper coins that wouldn't buy him breakfast in any proper town. The wine bottle, at least, was fully empty. He'd made certain of that.

He was surveying his disheveled belongings when he heard it.

The song.

It came from somewhere above, a melody so pure and haunting that Sefiathan forgot his headache, forgot his shame, forgot everything except the aching beauty of that sound. It spoke of heights unimaginable and distances unconquered, of wind beneath wings and the vast freedom of sky. It was the song of flight itself, translated into music.

Sefiathan craned his neck, searching the branches.

There, perched on a low-hanging bough perhaps ten feet up, sat the ugliest bird he had ever seen.

It defied easy description. Its body seemed assembled from the spare parts of several different creatures—too large a head for its scrawny neck, wings that hung at odd angles and appeared to be molting in patches, tail feathers that jutted out in chaotic directions like a drunk's hair after a tavern brawl. One eye was larger than the other. Its beak was slightly crooked. And its coloring suggested it had fallen into a dye vat and then rolled through ash and mud for good measure—splotches of faded brown, gray, and an unfortunate greenish tinge.

The bird opened its crooked beak and sang again.

The sound was impossible. How could something so wretched-looking produce something so transcendent? The melody soared and dipped, full of longing and joy, painting pictures in the air of places Sefiathan had never been, things he'd never done, a version of himself he'd never managed to become.

The bird shuffled along the branch, and Sefiathan saw that its movements were awkward, uncertain. It hopped once, twice, testing its weight. Its mismatched wings fluttered but didn't seem quite capable of coordinated action. This creature looked like it had no business being in a tree at all, let alone dreaming of flight.

And yet it sang of soaring.

Sefiathan found himself smiling—the first genuine smile since he'd left home. Here was a kindred spirit, wasn't it? A thing poorly assembled, not quite right, singing a song it had no business singing about a thing it seemed constitutionally incapable of doing.

The bird sang a third time, and Sefiathan heard in it not just beauty, but defiance. It didn't matter that its wings were wrong, that its body was ungainly, that by all reasonable assessment it should never leave the ground. It sang anyway. It sang of flight with such conviction that for a moment, watching it, Sefiathan almost believed those crooked wings might catch the wind.

"Sing yourself into flight," Sefiathan whispered to the bird. "Maybe that's how it works. Maybe the song comes first."

The bird tilted its too-large head, fixing him with its mismatched gaze, and sang one more phrase before hopping backward along the branch and disappearing into the deeper foliage.

Sefiathan sat there for a long moment, listening to his hangover pulse behind his eyes, feeling the dampness of his cloak, cataloging his failures. He was poorly assembled too. Wrong in ways he couldn't quite name. Twenty-seven years old and still waiting to discover what he was for.

But the bird had sung anyway.

Slowly, Sefiathan gathered his scattered belongings. He packed them with more care than he'd shown in days. He stood, testing his balance, and began to walk north along the forest path—the direction he'd chosen at random but would now commit to.

And as he walked, Sefiathan Murrgood began to hum.

It wasn't much of a song yet. The melody was uncertain, wandering, searching for itself the way he was searching for whatever he was meant to become. But it was a beginning. It was the first note of his own ugly-bird song, the sound of someone who didn't know how to fly but who would sing of it anyway.

The year stretched ahead of him, full of days he couldn't yet imagine, in a land he'd barely begun to know. Parogar was vast—holding kingdoms and wastelands, wonders and horrors, magic that obeyed rules and magic that scorned them. It held answers, perhaps, or at least better questions.

Sefiathan hummed his broken melody and walked toward whatever morning would bring, carrying nothing but his few possessions and the memory of an impossible song from an impossible bird.

It was enough, he thought, to take the first step.

It was enough to begin.
