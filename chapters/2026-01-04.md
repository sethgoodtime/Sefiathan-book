Day 4: Raskell

The village of Raskell was smaller than Sefiathan expected—perhaps two dozen buildings clustered around a central common, with fields spreading out in neat rectangles beyond. It had the tidy, practical look of a place where everyone knew everyone and strangers were noted the moment they appeared on the road.

They were noted indeed. By the time their small group reached the common, at least six villagers had stopped their evening tasks to watch, and an elderly woman with a walking stick was making her way toward them with the determined stride of someone who held authority.

"Torval," the woman said, not quite warmly but not unfriendly either. "Didn't expect to see you back so soon."

"Marra." Torval nodded respectfully. "Just passing through. Need to camp for the night, buy some supplies if you've got them to spare."

Marra's sharp eyes moved over their group, lingering on each person. When her gaze reached Sefiathan, he fought the urge to look away. There was something in her expression that reminded him of his grandmother—that quality of seeing right through whatever face you presented to the uncomfortable truth underneath.

"And your companions?" Marra asked.

"Hired help," Torval said, which was both true and not true in ways that Sefiathan didn't fully understand. "They're no trouble."

"Mm." Marra's tone suggested she had opinions about that claim. "The usual rate for camping. Three copper per person for the night, includes access to the well and permission to light fires. If you want to buy food, Renn's got some dried meat and preserved vegetables she might part with. If you want fresh bread, you're out of luck—we bake on seventh-days and today's the fourth."

Torval was already reaching for his coin purse, but Sefiathan felt a spike of panic. Three copper per person. He had exactly three copper to his name. If he paid to camp, he'd have nothing left. No money for food, for supplies, for the rest of his journey.

He must have made some sound, some small betrayal of distress, because the hooded woman turned to look at him. She studied him for a moment, then spoke quietly to Torval. "Cover his camping fee. I'll pay you back."

"We're not—" Torval started.

"Yes, we are. Consider it payment for carrying messages north. He said he'd keep an eye out for strangers going that way."

It was a face-saving lie, a kindness disguised as practicality. Sefiathan wanted to protest, to maintain his pride, but his pride couldn't shelter him for the night or fill his belly tomorrow.

"Thank you," he managed.

The woman didn't acknowledge it. She'd already turned away, pulling her hood lower as if to discourage conversation.

Torval counted out coins—nine copper for the three of them, then three more. Twelve total for a night's camping and, apparently, for one stubborn young man who'd left home with insufficient planning.

Marra pocketed the coins and pointed to a section of the common on the far side, near a line of trees. "Camp there. Fires only in the stone rings. We've had dry weather, and I won't have you burning down the village. There's a privy behind Renn's shop—third building on the left. Use it. We don't want any... evidence left in the common."

"Understood," Torval said.

As they made their way to the camping area, Mikken leaned close to Sefiathan and whispered, "That's what I call village hospitality. 'Pay us money and don't shit in our common.' Really makes you feel welcome, doesn't it?"

Despite everything, Sefiathan smiled.

They set up camp as the sun began to set, transforming the sky into layers of orange and deep purple. Torval had a tent—a practical, well-made thing that went up quickly. Mikken had what he called a "tent" but which looked more like several pieces of fabric tied together with optimistic faith. The hooded woman simply laid out a bedroll beneath a tree, apparently content to sleep under the stars.

Sefiathan had a blanket. That was it. He'd left home assuming he'd find inns, or other travelers to share fires with, or that somehow the universe would provide. Looking at his single thin blanket, he recognized it for what it was: the supplies of someone who'd been running away rather than journeying toward.

"You can share my tent," Mikken offered, apparently reading Sefiathan's expression. "It's not much, but it beats freezing. Fair warning though—I snore. Loudly. Torval says it sounds like a bear with respiratory problems."

"I do not say that," Torval said. "I say it sounds like two bears fighting over a fish."

"Well then! You're welcome to share accommodations with two fighting bears!" Mikken grinned. "What do you say?"

Sefiathan wanted to refuse. His pride, already battered from accepting money for camping, rebelled at the idea of being dependent on these strangers for shelter too. But the night was getting cold, and pride wouldn't keep him warm.

"Yes. Thank you. I'd appreciate that."

"Excellent! I promise to only kick you in my sleep two or three times maximum."

While Mikken busied himself with his chaotic tent setup, Sefiathan sat on a log near the fire ring and watched Torval efficiently arrange kindling. The man worked with the ease of long practice, building a small pyramid of dry grass and thin twigs, then striking flint against steel to create sparks.

The fire caught quickly, small flames growing into something warm and steady.

"Can I ask you something?" Sefiathan said.

Torval didn't look up from feeding the fire. "You can ask. I might not answer."

"Why did you let me come along? You didn't want to. You made that clear."

Torval was quiet for a moment, adjusting a burning branch with a stick. "Because she asked," he finally said, nodding toward the hooded woman. "And because I remember being twenty-seven and thinking I had to figure everything out alone. Took me another five years and a lot of mistakes to learn that sometimes the strong thing is asking for help."

"But you said I should stop waiting for permission. That I should act like an adult."

"Those aren't contradictions." Torval sat back, satisfied with the fire. "You can ask for help and still take responsibility for your own journey. You can accept support and still carry your own weight. The problem isn't wanting help. The problem is expecting others to do your work for you or to save you from consequences."

Sefiathan thought about that. About the difference between asking someone to support your head while you figured out how to stand versus asking them to carry you. About taking shelter in Mikken's tent tonight but still walking his own path tomorrow.

"What are you really looking for?" Sefiathan asked. "I know you said it's complicated, but you're all clearly searching for something specific. Or someone."

Torval's expression hardened. "That's not your concern."

"I'm walking north with you. I might see something useful. Wouldn't it help if I knew what I was looking for?"

"No."

The finality in Torval's voice made it clear the conversation was over. Sefiathan felt frustration rise in his chest—not anger exactly, but a kind of helpless irritation at being kept on the outside, at being tolerated but not trusted.

The hooded woman approached the fire, holding a small pot and a packet of something wrapped in cloth. She settled near the flames without a word and began preparing what looked like tea, adding dried leaves and herbs to water she must have drawn from the village well.

"He wants to know what we're looking for," Torval said to her.

"Of course he does. He's curious. That's good." She measured out herbs with careful precision, not looking at either of them. "But curiosity doesn't entitle him to our secrets. We all carry things we're not ready to share."

"I'm not trying to pry," Sefiathan said, though he absolutely was trying to pry. "I just thought—"

"You thought that if you prove yourself useful, we might trust you more. That if you understand our mission, you'll have a role, a purpose." The woman looked up, firelight reflecting in those strange silver-flecked eyes. "You're trying to earn your place by making yourself necessary to our story. But that's not how this works."

Sefiathan felt exposed again, his motivations laid bare. "Then how does it work?"

"You walk your path. We walk ours. For a brief time, our paths overlap. That's enough. You don't need to be part of our quest to have value. Your journey stands on its own."

"But my journey doesn't have a purpose," Sefiathan said, and heard the frustration in his own voice. "I'm just... wandering. Hoping I'll find something. You all know what you're looking for. You have a goal."

"And it's making us miserable," Mikken said cheerfully, finally joining them at the fire. His tent was up—or at least, something tent-like was standing. "We've been chasing this thing for three months now. Three months of following dead-end leads, asking questions in villages where no one wants to talk to us, sleeping on the ground, eating terrible food. Meanwhile, you're on a journey of self-discovery! That's so much more interesting!"

"It doesn't feel interesting. It feels aimless."

"Maybe aimless is underrated," Mikken said. "Maybe having too much focus makes you rigid. Torval here is so focused on our goal that he barely notices anything else. Beautiful sunset? Don't care, we need to make five more miles. Fascinating local festival? No time, we have to question the innkeeper. Traveling musician offering to teach me advanced juggling techniques? Absolutely not, we're on a schedule."

"The musician was a con artist trying to steal your coin purse," Torval said.

"Was he? Or was that just your suspicious nature preventing a beautiful moment of artistic exchange?"

The hooded woman made a sound that might have been a laugh. She poured the now-steaming tea into three wooden cups and offered one to Sefiathan.

"I don't have money to pay for this," he said quietly.

"I'm not charging you. It's tea. I'm sharing it because that's what people do around fires." She handed cups to Torval and Mikken as well. "Stop keeping score of every kindness. It's exhausting."

Sefiathan accepted the cup, feeling the warmth seep into his cold hands. The tea smelled of mint and something else he couldn't identify—something that reminded him of autumn evenings and the gardens his mother used to tend. He sipped it carefully. It was good. Better than good.

"What's in this?" he asked.

"Mint from Kethril, dreamleaf from the southern marshes, and a bit of honey I traded for two days ago. The dreamleaf will help you sleep without nightmares. You've been having them, I think."

Sefiathan wanted to ask how she knew, but he already understood. She read people the way others read books. There was no point in denying it.

"Thank you," he said simply.

They sat in silence for a while, drinking tea and watching the fire. The village around them was settling into evening routines—lights appearing in windows, the sound of a child being called inside for supper, somewhere a dog barking at nothing in particular.

"My mother was a hedge witch," Sefiathan said suddenly, surprising himself. He hadn't planned to share this. "Not a powerful one. She could encourage plants to grow, could make poultices that worked better than they should have, could sometimes sense when storms were coming. Small magics. Useful magics."

The others listened without interrupting.

"Everyone thought I'd inherit it. That I'd be able to do what she did, or maybe something different but equally useful. But nothing ever manifested. No affinity for plants, no weather sense, no healing touch. Just... nothing." He stared into his tea. "My father tried to teach me his trade—he's a carpenter—but I'm clumsy with tools. My sister is brilliant with numbers and managing the family accounts. I'm the one who doesn't quite fit anywhere."

"So you left," the hooded woman said.

"So I left. Told myself it was a journey of self-discovery, a pilgrimage of betterment. But really I was just running away from being the disappointment."

"And now?"

"Now I'm sitting in a village I'll never see again, drinking charity tea, sleeping in a borrowed tent, being supported by strangers because I was too proud or too stupid to properly prepare for this journey." He laughed without humor. "I don't feel like I'm getting better. I feel like I'm getting more lost."

Torval shifted, poking at the fire. "You know what the problem with journeys is?"

"What?"

"The first week is always terrible. You're still close enough to home to doubt your decision. You're not far enough along to see any results. You're just in the messy middle where everything feels like a mistake." He looked at Sefiathan directly. "But that doesn't mean it is a mistake. It means you're doing something hard, and hard things feel bad at the beginning."

"How do you know it gets better?"

"I don't. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe you'll wander for a year and end up right back where you started with nothing to show for it." Torval shrugged. "But at least you'll know. At least you'll have tried. That's more than most people do."

It wasn't inspirational, exactly. But somehow it was comforting—the acknowledgment that maybe this wouldn't work, that trying didn't guarantee success, but that trying anyway had its own value.

Mikken raised his cup. "To trying! And to spectacular failures that make excellent stories later!"

Despite himself, Sefiathan smiled and raised his cup as well.

They finished their tea as the fire burned lower. The hooded woman produced a small loaf of bread from her pack—where she'd gotten it, Sefiathan didn't know—and broke it into pieces to share. It was dark and dense, the kind of bread that sustained rather than delighted, but Sefiathan ate his portion gratefully.

"What's your name?" he asked the woman. "Your real name. You said you told Mikken and he forgot, but I'd like to know. If you're willing to share."

She was quiet for so long that Sefiathan thought she might not answer. Then: "Lyrei. My name is Lyrei."

"Lyrei," Sefiathan repeated, trying to feel the shape of it. "Thank you. For the tea. And the bread. And the truth-telling, even when it's uncomfortable."

"You're welcome, Sefiathan Murrgood." She stood, brushing crumbs from her cloak. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow you'll walk north, and we'll walk north, and our paths will diverge. But tonight, you're not alone. Let that be enough."

She retreated to her bedroll under the tree, becoming just another shadow among shadows.

Sefiathan helped Mikken clean up the tea cups and pack away the remaining bread. Then they retired to Mikken's chaotic tent, which smelled of old canvas and something vaguely spicy. Mikken was asleep within minutes, and yes, he did snore like bears fighting over fish.

But Sefiathan, warm from the dreamleaf tea and full from shared bread, found himself drifting into sleep more easily than he had in weeks. His last thought before darkness took him was of the ugly bird, singing its impossible song.

Maybe trying was enough.

Maybe the song didn't need to be complete yet.

Maybe Day Four had been exactly what it needed to be.
