Day 35 - February 4, 2026
They left the waystation at first light, heading deeper into the Frostmere. The frozen marshland stretched endlessly in all directions, broken only by those strange ice formations that caught morning light and refracted it in blues and whites and occasional flashes of rainbow.
Sefiathan found his mind circling the same worry it had been circling for days: what would he find at the gathering? What if he didn't belong there? What if the wind-readers took one look at him and knew he was a fraud—someone searching for magic he didn't have, pretending to be on a meaningful journey when really he was just running away from home?
The thought loop had worn a groove in his mind. He kept returning to it, examining it from different angles, building elaborate scenarios of rejection and exposure. His brain creating problems that didn't exist yet, maybe never would exist, just to have something to obsess over.
Because sitting with the uncertainty of not knowing felt unbearable.
Korrin must have noticed his silence, his inward focus, because they spoke without looking back. "You're in your head."
"Yeah."
"What's it doing to you in there?"
"Building problems that don't exist yet." Sefiathan watched his feet, one step after another across frozen ground. "Trying to figure out what will happen at the gathering so I can prepare for it."
"How's that working?"
"It's not. I just keep spinning the same scenarios. Getting more anxious. Creating more elaborate disasters."
"Mental theater," Tavis said from behind them. "I'm an expert at it. Can spend hours in my head rehearsing conversations that never happen, preparing for criticisms that never come, defending against attacks that don't exist."
"How do you stop it?"
"I don't, usually. But the wind-readers taught me something that helps sometimes." Tavis paused. "They say when you notice you're in mental theater, the solution isn't more thinking. It's moving your body instead."
Sefiathan considered that. His brain wanted to figure this out, wanted to think his way to certainty. But thinking was precisely what was trapping him in the loop.
Without planning it, he stopped walking and dropped to the ground. Did ten quick push-ups right there on the frozen marsh, his hands burning from the cold. When he stood up, breathing hard, the thought loop had dissolved.
Korrin was watching him with amusement. "That's one way to do it."
"My brain was creating problems. So I gave my body a different problem." Sefiathan brushed frost off his hands. "Turns out it's hard to obsess about imaginary future disasters while your arms are burning."
They continued walking, and Sefiathan noticed the difference. The obsessive thoughts tried to return—what if the wind-readers reject you, what if you don't belong, what if this whole journey has been pointless—but they had less grip now. Less urgency.
Just thoughts. Mental theater. His brain's attempt to control uncertainty by imagining every possible outcome.
Around midday they stopped to rest and eat. Sefiathan found himself starting to spiral again—analyzing the gathering, trying to predict how it would go, building scenarios. He caught himself, stood up, and walked a wide circle around their resting spot. Just moving. Letting his body do something while his brain quieted.
"You're learning," Korrin observed.
"Learning what?"
"To notice when you're obsessing. To interrupt it before it traps you." They handed him some dried fruit. "Most people can't even see they're doing it. They think the obsessive thought loop is reality, not mental theater."
"I still don't know what will happen at the gathering," Sefiathan said. "That uncertainty still feels unbearable."
"And yet you're bearing it." Tavis gestured at him, at the landscape around them. "You're here. Moving forward. Not knowing what comes next. The uncertainty isn't actually unbearable—your brain just keeps saying it is so you'll give it something to obsess over."
Sefiathan sat with that. The uncertainty was uncomfortable, yes. But unbearable? No. He was bearing it right now. Had been bearing it for thirty-five days. Every day not knowing what would come next, and every day continuing anyway.
The mental theater was just his brain's way of trying to make uncertainty feel manageable through preparation. But the preparation was impossible—he couldn't know what would happen until it happened. All the rehearsing just kept him trapped in his head, disconnected from his body, removed from the present moment.
That afternoon, the landscape began to change. The flat marshland gave way to rolling terrain, and in the distance Sefiathan could see structures—buildings, tents, smoke rising from fires. The gathering.
His brain immediately started: what if they're all more advanced than you, what if you can't read wind at all, what if they ask what you're doing here and you don't have a good answer, what if—
He stopped walking and did twenty jumping jacks. Korrin and Tavis watched without comment, waiting. When he finished, breathing hard, the obsessive loop had broken again.
"Better?" Korrin asked.
"Better."
They approached the gathering slowly. It was larger than Sefiathan had imagined—maybe forty or fifty people scattered across an area the size of a small village. Centaurs and humans and a few fae, all gathered around various fires, some in conversation, some sitting in meditation, some actively working with what looked like practice exercises.
Nobody looked particularly advanced or mystical. They just looked like—people. Trying to figure things out.
A woman approached them as they entered the outer edge of the gathering. Human, maybe fifty, with gray hair and a warm smile. "Korrin! You made it. And you brought friends."
"Calantha." Korrin embraced her briefly. "This is Tavis, my cousin. And Sefiathan, who's—" They paused, and Sefiathan realized they didn't actually know how to describe him.
"Someone trying to figure things out," Sefiathan offered.
"Perfect. You'll fit right in." Calantha gestured around the gathering. "We're all trying to figure things out. Some of us have been trying for decades. Come, I'll show you where you can set up camp."
As they walked through the gathering, Sefiathan noticed people watching them—but not judgmentally. Just curious. A few waved. One centaur called out a greeting to Korrin. Nobody seemed concerned about whether Sefiathan belonged or had the right credentials or was on the correct type of journey.
They just—welcomed him.
His brain tried to start a new loop: what if they're just being polite, what if later they'll realize you're not supposed to be here, what if—
Sefiathan shook his head physically, disrupting the thought. Noticed his feet on the ground. His breath in his lungs. The cold air on his face. Present. Here. Now. Not in mental theater about imaginary future problems.
Calantha showed them a good spot to set up camp—near enough to the main fires for warmth but far enough for some privacy. As they started unpacking, she turned to Sefiathan.
"What brings you to the gathering?"
The question he'd been obsessing over. The one he'd prepared seventeen different answers for in his mental theater. But standing here, present, the answer was simpler than all his rehearsal.
"I don't know," he said honestly. "My instincts said to come. So I came."
"Good enough." Calantha smiled. "The ones who come with elaborate explanations usually leave first. The ones who come because something pulled them here—they're the ones who stay. Welcome to the gathering, Sefiathan. I hope you find whatever you didn't know you were looking for."
She left them to set up camp. Sefiathan stood holding his pack, feeling something settle in his chest. All that obsessing, all that mental theater, all those prepared answers—none of it had been necessary.
The uncertainty had been bearable all along.
His brain had just been creating problems to avoid feeling it.
That evening, as they sat around their fire and watched the larger gathering settle into night rhythms, Sefiathan felt his mind trying to start new loops. What will tomorrow bring, what if you can't learn to read wind, what if—
He stood up and walked. Just walked around the camp, feeling his body move, his feet on frozen ground. When he returned to the fire, the loop had dissolved.
"You're getting good at that," Tavis observed.
"At interrupting the theater?"
"At choosing body over brain. At moving instead of obsessing." Tavis poked at the fire. "Took me years to learn that. You're picking it up in days."
Sefiathan settled back by the fire, his melody humming in his chest. Tonight it had a quality of presence—not thinking about what comes next, just being here now. In his body. On the ground. Present.
The gathering continued around them. Wind moved across the Frostmere, carrying sounds and smells and the cold promise of deeper winter ahead.
And Sefiathan sat with uncertainty, bearing it, letting his brain create its theater while his body stayed present and real and here.
Tomorrow would come. Things would happen. He'd respond to them as they arose.
For tonight, this was enough.
Moving his body. Stopping the obsessing. Bearing the uncertainty that his brain kept insisting was unbearable.
One moment. One breath. One step at a time.
Present. Here. Now.
Not in mental theater about problems that didn't exist yet.
Just—alive.
