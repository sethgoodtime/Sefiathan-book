Day 28 - January 28, 2026
Morning came gray and soft, the kind of light that didn't announce itself but simply arrived. Sefiathan woke to find Korrin already moving around camp, but slowly, without the efficiency of yesterday. They were just—standing there, looking at the trees.
"Morning," Sefiathan said, sitting up.
Korrin turned, and their expression was different. Quieter. "Morning. How'd you sleep?"
"Fine." Sefiathan stretched, working out the stiffness of sleeping on ground. "You?"
"Barely." Korrin returned to looking at the trees. "Kept thinking about my cousin. The one I'm meeting at the Frostmere. We haven't spoken in two years. Ended badly."
Sefiathan started to ask what happened, then stopped himself. The question felt sharp, invasive. Like he'd be picking at something tender.
"I'm worried it'll be awkward," Korrin continued. "That we won't know what to say. That the silence will be—" They paused. "Heavy."
"Yeah," Sefiathan said, because he understood that weight.
They packed up camp in quiet, but it wasn't uncomfortable. Just—present. The silence between them felt like space, not emptiness. Korrin was carrying something, and Sefiathan was letting them carry it without trying to fix it.
As they walked, Sefiathan found himself noticing things he'd normally catalog as problems. A bird's nest fallen from a tree, cracked open and empty. A patch of wildflowers growing in a particularly inhospitable spot between rocks. A tree that had been struck by lightning, half of it dead and blackened while the other half still grew green.
His usual response would be to judge these things. The nest was sad—something had failed. The flowers were struggling—they should be somewhere easier. The tree was damaged—it would probably die eventually.
But today, looking at them felt different. Gentler.
The nest had held life and now didn't, and that was just what nests did. The flowers were growing where they'd seeded, making the most of impossible circumstances. The tree was half-dead and half-alive, and both halves were true at once.
Nothing needed his criticism. Nothing needed him to identify what was wrong.
Around midday they stopped to rest near a small clearing where the sun broke through the pine cover. Korrin unpacked food but didn't eat right away, just sat holding an apple like they'd forgotten what it was for.
"I was too harsh with my cousin," Korrin said finally. "Two years ago. They were going through something difficult and I—I was sharp about it. Told them they needed to handle things better. Be stronger." They took a bite of the apple, chewed slowly. "I thought I was helping. Being honest. But I was just—critical."
Sefiathan thought about yesterday's theme, about building cases to avoid hurt. And today's—about criticism, about the sharpness he aimed at the world when he aimed it at himself.
"Were you being critical of them," he asked carefully, "or of yourself?"
Korrin looked at him, surprised. "What do you mean?"
"Sometimes when I'm sharp with other people, it's because I'm already being sharp with myself. Like—I'm disappointed in me, so I'm disappointed in everything." Sefiathan pulled at grass beside him. "The world hasn't gotten worse, but my relationship to it gets harsh when I'm harsh with myself first."
Korrin set down the apple. "That's—yeah. That's probably right." They were quiet for a moment. "I'd just left my herd. Was trying to figure out how to be a centaur outside of centaur territory. Felt like I was failing at it every day. And then my cousin was struggling too, and instead of—I don't know, being gentle—I criticized them for not handling it better."
"Like if they could handle it better, maybe you could too."
"Yeah."
They sat with that for a while. The sun was warm where it reached them through the trees. A butterfly landed on a nearby rock, opened and closed its wings slowly.
"I don't know how to be less critical," Sefiathan admitted. "Of myself, of others. It's like—it's how I see things. Finding what's wrong. What needs fixing."
"Mm." Korrin picked up the apple again, studying it. "My herd's wind-readers have this practice. When they're learning to read wind, they first have to practice just—noticing it. Not analyzing it, not predicting what it means. Just feeling it move across their skin and acknowledging it's there." They took another bite. "They say the sharp criticism comes when you skip the noticing part. When you go straight to judgment without pausing in observation."
Sefiathan thought about that. How quickly he moved from seeing something to judging it. The nest was sad. The flowers were struggling. The tree was damaged. He'd never just—looked at them. Let them be what they were before deciding what they meant.
"So I should practice noticing?"
"Can't hurt." Korrin stood, brushing off their legs. "And maybe—cut yourself some slack while you're learning. You're allowed to be bad at gentleness while you're learning gentleness."
They walked through afternoon with that thought settling in. Sefiathan tried the practice—noticing things without immediately judging them. A fallen log covered in moss. Just noticing: fallen, horizontal, green with life that wasn't tree-life. Not adding: it's dead, it's rotting, it's in the way.
A stream cutting across their path, running fast over rocks. Noticing: water, movement, sound like rushing. Not adding: we'll have to cross it, it's an obstacle, this will slow us down.
The practice was harder than it seemed. His brain wanted to jump to judgment, to figure out what everything meant for him, how he should respond to it. But pausing in that space between seeing and judging—that space felt gentler. Less sharp.
By late afternoon they'd climbed higher into hill country. The pines grew thicker here, and the ground was soft with needles that muffled their footsteps. The air had a particular quality—that edge-of-mountains crispness that suggested bigger peaks somewhere ahead.
They made camp in a grove where the trees created a natural shelter. Korrin moved through the setup rituals more like themselves—the heaviness of the morning had eased somewhat. Not gone, but less crushing.
"Thank you," Korrin said as they built up the fire. "For earlier. Not trying to fix the thing with my cousin."
"I don't know how to fix that kind of thing."
"That's why it helped." Korrin smiled slightly. "You just—let me carry it. Didn't try to solve it or talk me out of feeling bad. Just walked beside me while I felt bad."
Sefiathan prodded the fire, watching sparks spiral up. "I think I'm usually too sharp because I'm trying to fix things. Make them better, make myself better. But maybe some things just—are. And being sharp about them doesn't help."
"The wind-readers say the world is always exactly what it is. Your relationship to it can shift, but the world itself just—continues." Korrin pulled out their evening supplies, started preparing food. "The trick is noticing the difference between the world and your relationship to it."
They cooked together, the familiar rhythm of camp tasks. Sefiathan tried to stay in noticing—the smell of cooking food, the warmth of fire, the sound of wind in pines overhead. Not judging whether it was good or bad, just—experiencing it.
After eating, they sat by the fire in comfortable quiet. The kind of silence that didn't need filling. Korrin cleaned their pot with pine needles, a trick Sefiathan made note of without criticizing himself for not knowing it already.
"Do you think you'll know what to say?" Sefiathan asked. "To your cousin?"
"No." Korrin set the pot aside. "But maybe that's okay. Maybe I can just—be there. Notice them without immediately judging whether they're doing better or worse than last time. Let them be what they are."
"That sounds gentle."
"It sounds terrifying," Korrin said, but they were smiling. "But probably gentler than what I did before."
The fire burned down to coals. Stars appeared through gaps in the pine canopy. Sefiathan thought about his own sharpness—toward himself, toward his family, toward the world. How much of it came from trying to fix everything, make everything better, prove he could handle things properly.
What would it be like to just—notice? To see himself without immediately cataloging everything wrong? To look at his family without building a case about their failures or his own?
To look at the world with gentler eyes.
His melody came to him as he settled into his bedroll, and tonight it had a quality of softness he hadn't heard before. Not weakness—something else. Like the difference between a sharp blade and a smooth stone. Both real, both useful, but one could be held without drawing blood.
The pines whispered overhead. The coals glowed in the dark. And Sefiathan practiced noticing—his breath, his heartbeat, the weight of his body on ground.
Not judging whether it was good enough. Just—noticing it was there.
Tomorrow he'd try again. Notice things before criticizing them. Pause in that gentle space between seeing and judging. Let the world be what it was while his relationship to it slowly shifted.
Not better yet. Just—gentler.
The practice of softer eyes.
