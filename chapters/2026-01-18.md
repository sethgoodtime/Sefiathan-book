Day 18: The Next Right Step

Sefiathan woke with clarity he hadn't felt in years.

Not enlightenment—nothing so dramatic. Just a quiet certainty about what came next, the kind that appears when you stop overthinking and let the obvious reveal itself.

He'd been walking north because north felt right, following streams and game trails, moving deeper into the Deepwood without a clear destination. It had been exactly what he needed—aimless exploration, letting the journey unfold. But somewhere during the night, sleeping under stars visible through the imperfect campsite he'd chosen, something had settled.

He needed a destination.

Not forever. Not some grand purpose that would define his entire year. Just—the next thing. The next right step, clear enough to walk toward without endless revision.

Sefiathan made breakfast and pulled out the rough map Maren had sketched for him weeks ago at the Crossroads Post. Her drawing was simple: the stream he'd been following, the Deepwood marked as a vague green blob, and to the north—marked with a small X—something labeled "The Singing Stones."

She hadn't explained what that meant. Sefiathan had assumed it was just another landmark, noted and forgotten. But looking at it now, with this new clarity, he felt something click into place.

That's where he was going. The Singing Stones.

Not because they held answers or would transform him or because going there would complete some quest. Just because it was the next right step, and the next right step was obvious if he quit overthinking it.

Sefiathan studied the map, trying to estimate distance and direction. Maybe three days north from his current position, if he kept a steady pace. Through denser Deepwood, following the waterways, watching for whatever signs marked the way.

Three days. A clear goal. Simple enough to commit to without spiraling into endless planning.

He packed his camp efficiently, the routine so familiar now it required almost no thought. Fire scattered, stones returned to their places, ground swept clean of his presence. The only mark he left was a small cairn—three stones stacked deliberately—positioned where morning light would hit them. Not for any grand reason. Just because he liked the way they looked, and making small monuments to moments felt right.

Walking north through the Deepwood, Sefiathan found himself moving with more purpose than before. Not rushing—his ankle reminded him to stay mindful—but with direction. He wasn't just wandering anymore. He was walking toward something, even if that something was just a place on a map he knew nothing about.

The forest seemed to notice the shift. Or maybe Sefiathan was just paying attention differently. He spotted things he would have missed before: a tree marked with three parallel scratches at shoulder height, clearly deliberate. A cairn similar to the one he'd made, older and moss-covered, marking some previous traveler's path. A section where the ferns grew in an almost perfect circle, like something had been planted there generations ago.

Signs. Not magical or mystical, just evidence that people had passed through here before. Had made marks. Had created rough outlines that others could follow without endless revision.

By midday, Sefiathan reached a fork in the terrain—not a split path, but a choice point. Left would take him along easier ground, following a valley. Right would climb into hills, harder walking but more direct according to Maren's map.

The old Sefiathan would have stopped here. Would have weighed every option, researched the terrain, tried to find the perfect balance of difficulty and efficiency. Would have stood at this fork for an hour, paralyzed by the fear of choosing wrong.

But his head was clearer than it had been in weeks. The next right step was obvious: go right. Take the harder, more direct route. Not because suffering was noble, but because direct was honest. Because sometimes the straightforward path was better than the easy one, even if it cost more effort.

Sefiathan went right.

The terrain climbed steadily through the afternoon. His legs burned. His healed ankle held but complained. The pack felt heavier with each step. But he'd made a choice, committed to it, and was seeing it through without second-guessing.

That evening, when he crested a ridge and looked down into a valley where a river cut through old growth forest, Sefiathan felt something loosen in his chest. He'd made a plan—rough, imperfect, subject to change—and had followed it. Had taken the next right step without drowning in revision.

And nothing had broken. He was exactly where he'd intended to be: closer to the Singing Stones, wherever they were, whatever they turned out to be.

He made camp on the ridge, in a spot that was purely practical. Flat ground, nearby water source visible below, good sight lines. No mountain views or special qualities. Just functional. And that felt right too—not every choice needed to be significant. Some choices were just choices, made and moved past.

As darkness fell, Sefiathan pulled out his journal. Not to process or learn, just to mark the moment:

*Day 18: Made a plan. Going to the Singing Stones. Three days north, more or less. Feels good to have a destination, even a temporary one. The next right step is obvious when I stop overthinking it.*

He closed the journal and added wood to his fire, watching sparks drift upward toward stars. Tomorrow he'd wake up and keep walking north. Would follow the rough outline he'd made without revising it endlessly. Would trust that clarity that had appeared when he stopped trying to figure out everything at once.

The Singing Stones would be whatever they were. The journey there would teach him whatever it taught him. And after that—well, there would be another next right step, and another after that.

But that was future Sefiathan's problem. Present Sefiathan just needed to walk north for three days and see what he found.

His melody came to him as he settled into sleep, and tonight it had a directional quality—still expansive, still his own, but moving toward something rather than just existing in space. The song had a destination now, even if that destination was just three days north and marked with an X on a rough map.

It was enough. Having a plan—rough and imperfect and subject to change—was enough.

The next right step was obvious.

All he had to do was take it.
