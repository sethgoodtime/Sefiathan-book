Day 6: The Weight You Carry

The Wildlands swallowed sound.

That was the first thing Sefiathan noticed as he walked deeper into the ancient forest. Not that it was silent—he could hear birds calling, branches creaking, the whisper of wind through leaves—but somehow the forest absorbed noise, dampened it, made everything feel muffled and close. His footsteps on the path seemed intrusive, too loud, like he was disturbing something that had been sleeping for a very long time.

The trees here were massive. Not just tall—though they were tall, stretching up so far that Sefiathan had to crane his neck backward to see where they ended—but wide. Ancient. Some of the trunks were broader than his house back in Millhaven. Their bark was thick and deeply furrowed, textured like the skin of impossibly old creatures. Moss grew in thick carpets up their sides, and strange shelf fungi jutted out at intervals like steps for something much larger than human.

Sefiathan had been walking for perhaps two hours since leaving Raskell when his shoulders started to ache.

It wasn't the pack. The pack was light—he didn't carry much. Just his blanket, his father's knife, the dried meat Torval had given him, the better waterskin, Mikken's ridiculous handkerchief with the dancing chicken, and Lyrei's piece of glass wrapped carefully in cloth. Maybe ten pounds total.

But his shoulders felt like they were carrying stones.

He tried adjusting the straps. Shifted the weight. Rolled his shoulders back. Nothing helped. The ache settled in deeper, spreading into his neck, making his upper back tight and uncomfortable. It was the kind of pain that made you want to stop walking, to sit down and figure out what was wrong.

Sefiathan pushed forward for another hour before he had to stop.

There was a clearing ahead—not large, maybe twenty feet across, where an ancient tree had fallen and created a gap in the canopy. Afternoon light streamed down in solid-looking shafts, catching dust and pollen and making the air look thick and golden. The fallen tree itself had been dead for years, its trunk hollow and home to countless insects and small creatures.

Sefiathan dropped his pack with more force than necessary and sat heavily on the fallen log. He rotated his shoulders, wincing. The ache was worse now. Like his body was trying to tell him something he didn't want to hear.

He pulled out his waterskin and drank, staring at the forest around him. Everything here felt old. Watchful. Patient in a way that made human urgency seem ridiculous.

*Your shoulders hurt because you've been carrying stories you should have cried about instead.*

Lyrei's words from that first day echoed in his head. He'd dismissed them at the time as more of her cryptic orb-wisdom, the kind of thing that sounded profound but didn't actually mean anything practical.

But sitting here, shoulders burning, he wondered.

What was he carrying?

Sefiathan closed his eyes and let himself inventory the weight. Not the physical pack—the other thing. The thing that made his shoulders feel like someone was pressing down on them with both hands.

His mother's disappointment. That was in there, definitely. The way she'd looked at him when his seventeenth birthday passed with no sign of magic manifesting. She'd never said anything—his mother was too kind for that—but he'd seen it in her eyes. The quiet resignation that he wouldn't be like her. That whatever spark she'd hoped to pass on had skipped him entirely.

His father's patient attempts to teach him carpentry, and his own clumsy failures. The way his father would correct the same mistake for the fifth, tenth, twentieth time, voice never sharp but also never quite hiding the weariness. *It's all right, son. Try again.* As if trying would eventually transform lack of talent into skill.

His sister's easy competence at everything she touched. The way she'd taken over the family accounts at fifteen and made them more profitable than they'd been in years. The way their parents smiled at her with uncomplicated pride, never having to measure their expectations against reality.

Twenty-seven years of not being quite good enough. Of being the son who didn't inherit magic, who couldn't master his father's craft, who had no particular talent except for noticing things and feeling too much about them.

Twenty-seven years of smiling and pretending it didn't matter while the weight of all those small inadequacies piled up on his shoulders like stones in a sack.

And then—this was harder to look at, but he made himself—there was the shame of leaving. The way he'd told everyone it was a journey of betterment, a pilgrimage, a quest. Noble words for running away. His sister had seen through it immediately. *Just admit you're scared,* she'd said the night before he left. *It's less embarrassing than this performance.*

But he couldn't admit he was scared. Couldn't say out loud that he was twenty-seven and terrified that this was it, that he'd plateau at mediocre and spend his whole life being the disappointment, the one who never quite figured it out. So instead he'd gotten drunk on snapberry wine and made grand pronouncements about finding his true self, and then woke up hungover in the forest with nothing to show for his bravery except a headache and an ugly bird's song.

The weight of pretending. That was maybe the heaviest thing.

Sefiathan opened his eyes. The golden light in the clearing had shifted slightly, dust motes dancing in the beams. He felt something wet on his cheeks and realized with surprise that he was crying.

Not sobbing. Just tears, sliding down his face quietly while he sat on a fallen log in a forest that didn't care about his failures.

It felt—strange. He couldn't remember the last time he'd actually cried. Years, probably. You didn't cry when you were trying to convince everyone (including yourself) that you were fine, that you had it together, that any day now you'd figure out your purpose and everything would click into place.

But here, alone in the Wildlands, with no one to perform for, the tears came easily.

He cried for his mother's unspoken disappointment. For his father's patient weariness. For his sister's easy competence that made his struggles look even more pathetic in comparison. He cried for twenty-seven years of not being enough, of carrying that knowledge around like a secret shame that everyone could see anyway.

And he cried for the ugly bird. For creatures that sang of flying when their wings were wrong and their bodies were ungainly and nothing about them suggested they should ever leave the ground. He cried because the bird had sung anyway, and somehow that made everything worse and better at the same time.

When the tears finally stopped, Sefiathan felt emptied out. Lighter. His shoulders still ached, but differently now—like a muscle worked hard rather than a burden carried too long.

He wiped his face with Mikken's handkerchief (the dancing chicken seemed weirdly appropriate for this moment) and took a long drink from his waterskin. The forest around him continued its ancient patience, unbothered by his emotional unraveling.

Sefiathan pulled Lyrei's piece of glass from his pack and held it up to the light. It fractured the golden afternoon into a dozen tiny rainbows, painting his hand with color.

*Feel it first, perform it later,* the Co-Star reading had said. Or something like that. The words weren't exact in his memory, but the meaning landed solid: stop turning your pain into entertainment for an imaginary audience. Stop making your suffering into a story before you've actually experienced it.

He'd been performing his journey from the moment he'd announced it. Making it noble and meaningful and purposeful because that was easier than admitting he had no idea what he was doing and was absolutely terrified of failing at even this.

But what if he just—stopped? What if he walked through Parogar for a year and let it be messy and aimless and sometimes beautiful and sometimes terrible, without trying to shape it into a narrative that proved anything?

What if the point wasn't to return home transformed, but just to—be somewhere different for a while? To see what happened when you weren't carrying all that weight of expectation and performance?

Sefiathan packed Lyrei's glass away carefully and shouldered his pack again. His shoulders still protested, but the pain felt more honest now. Physical rather than metaphysical. The kind of thing that would ease with walking rather than get worse with time.

He stood in the golden clearing for one more moment, letting the ancient trees witness this small transformation. Then he stepped back onto the path and continued north, deeper into the Wildlands.

The forest felt different now. Or maybe he felt different in it. Less like an intruder, more like—what? He wasn't sure yet. But something had shifted.

His melody came back as he walked, and this time he let it be sad. Let it carry the weight of things cried about, stories told truthfully rather than performed for effect. It wasn't complete yet. But it was more honest.

And in the Wildlands, where the trees remembered things older than kingdoms and the shadows held their own kind of wisdom, honest felt like the right place to start.

Sefiathan walked until the light began to fade, and when he made camp that night—just his blanket spread near a massive tree whose roots created natural shelter—he slept without dreams, lighter than he'd been in years.
