**Day 39 — February 8, 2026**

Orvenna didn't speak to him again that first day. Or the second. She sat on her granite perch above the ice and breathed, and when Sefiathan tried to mirror her stillness he found his mind spinning elaborate narratives about what she might be thinking, whether he was doing it wrong, if his presence was an intrusion she was too polite to name.

On the third morning she opened one eye and said, "You're very loud."

"I haven't said anything."

"Exactly." She closed the eye again. "Come back when you can sit without performing sitting."

He left burning with something between shame and indignation, the old familiar cocktail. Calantha found him later, aggressively reorganizing his pack by the tent — a task that needed doing about as much as the sky needed his permission to be blue.

"She told you you're loud, didn't she?" Calantha said.

"How did you—"

"She tells everyone that. It's not an insult. She means your thoughts are loud." Calantha sat down on a log that served as bench for half the eastern campers. "Wind-readers learn to read air currents, weather patterns, the motion of things. Orvenna reads the space between motion. The stillness. And you—" She gestured vaguely at him. "You fill every silence with wondering what the silence means."

"I don't know how to stop."

"You're not supposed to stop. You're supposed to notice you're doing it." She stood, brushed invisible dust from her trousers. "The difference between performance and presence is whether you're watching yourself the whole time."

She left him with that, which felt both generous and intensely annoying, which probably meant it was true.

Sefiathan spent the afternoon walking the perimeter of the Frostmere, not because he had a destination but because moving felt more honest than sitting still while mentally rehearsing better versions of sitting still. The ice sang its high glass-rim song. A crow followed him for half a mile, landing on stones ahead of him, waiting until he caught up, then flying to the next stone. He didn't assign it meaning. It was just a crow. He was just a man walking. Sometimes things happened alongside each other without being messages.

He thought about his father. Not the museum version — the critical voice, the dismissive glance, the preference for Mira's practical competence over Sefiathan's dreamy uncertainty. The actual man. Who was probably eating dinner right now in Millhaven. Who might have built something today, or not. Who existed independent of Sefiathan's story about him.

It was a strange thought. Disorienting. Like realizing the painting you'd been staring at for years was just a painting, and the actual landscape it depicted was somewhere else entirely, continuing without you.

The crow flew away without ceremony.

That night, lying in his bedroll with Korrin's steady breathing nearby and Tavis mumbling something in his sleep about proper declension, Sefiathan practiced not performing rest. He noticed the urge to arrange himself into the shape of peaceful slumber. Noticed his mind already writing tomorrow's narrative: *Sefiathan learned to be still, Sefiathan became wise, Sefiathan impressed the teacher*. Noticed how exhausting it was to constantly narrate his own life as though someone were grading it.

What if no one was watching? What if there was no test, no hidden meaning, no subliminal message in every interaction?

What if the simplest answer — that he was just here, learning, sometimes loud, sometimes quiet, sometimes getting it wrong — was usually right?

He fell asleep without deciding whether he'd figured anything out.

Morning came grey and cold. He went to Orvenna's granite slab without expectations, which was itself a kind of expectation he tried not to think about too hard. She was already there, of course. He sat down on the ice-slicked stone beside her, close enough to be present, far enough to not be presumptuous, and then realized he was calculating the geometry of proximity like it mattered.

He laughed. Just once, quiet, at himself.

Orvenna's mouth twitched. Might have been a smile. Might have been nothing.

"The wind under the ice," she said, not opening her eyes, "moves because it has nowhere else to go. It doesn't wonder if it's moving correctly. It doesn't perform depth. It just is deep." She breathed in, slow. "Stop trying to understand what I mean. Stop turning this into a lesson you can get right. Just sit with me and listen to the ground."

So he did. And his mind did its usual thing — spinning, connecting, wondering, narrating — but this time he didn't fight it. He watched it happen the way he might watch water flowing past in a stream, interesting, loud, his, but not something he had to redirect or judge or fix.

Under the ice, that deep humming presence was there again. Not waiting for him, exactly. Just there. Just being itself in the dark, the way wind moved without wondering, the way stones sat without performing stillness.

His attention settled on it. Not grasping. Not performing careful observation. Just noticing, the way you might notice your own heartbeat if you stopped trying to control it.

And the thing in the deep water hummed back — a response, maybe, or just continuation — and Sefiathan sat with Orvenna in the cold grey morning, loud in his own head, quieter than he'd been, learning that both could be true at once.
