Day 25: Absorbing Light

Sefiathan didn't leave the Singing Stones at dawn like he'd planned.

He woke with the intention clear in his mind—pack up, head south, get moving. But when he sat up and saw the way early light caught on the stones, turning them gold and amber, something in him just—stopped.

Not in a bad way. Not frozen or stuck. Just—still.

His brain had been running for weeks. Maybe months. Maybe years. Cataloging observations, processing lessons, figuring out next steps, planning routes, analyzing encounters, building and dismantling prisons. The constant hum of thinking that he'd mistaken for living.

Today, that hum was absent.

Sefiathan sat in his blanket, watching light move across stone, and did absolutely nothing productive.

He didn't pack. Didn't make breakfast. Didn't tend the fire or plan the day or worry about using time efficiently. He just sat there, absorbing sunlight like he was a plant. Breathing without analyzing his breath. Existing without purpose.

It felt strange at first. Wrong, almost. Like he should be doing something, accomplishing something, making progress toward some goal. The voice tried to chime in with helpful suggestions: *You're wasting the morning. You should be walking by now. This is lazy. This is—*

But Sefiathan let the voice talk to an empty room. He was busy being a plant.

The sun climbed higher. The stones' shadows shifted. A beetle crawled across the ground near his foot, following some beetle-purpose Sefiathan couldn't fathom. He watched it without needing to understand, without turning it into a metaphor or lesson.

Just—watching. Breathing. Existing.

By midmorning, Sefiathan still hadn't moved. He was hungry, but in a distant way that didn't require immediate action. Thirsty, but the water could wait. His body had needs, but for once they weren't urgent. They were just—there. Information, not demands.

He lay back on his blanket, looking up at sky through the spaces between stones. Clouds moved across his vision, changing shape, going nowhere and everywhere. The stones sang their wind-music. Birds called to each other about bird-things.

And Sefiathan did nothing.

Let someone else solve the problems you've been carrying.

The thought arrived without fanfare. He'd been carrying so much—not just his own problems, but imaginary ones too. Problems that might happen, problems other people might have with him, problems that existed only in the space between what happened and what he feared it meant.

Today, he let all of it go. Let the world solve its own problems. Let other people think what they thought. Let the future figure itself out.

He was a plant. Plants didn't solve problems. They absorbed sunlight and emitted oxygen and that was enough.

Hours passed. Or maybe minutes. Time felt different when you weren't tracking it, measuring it, spending it like currency. The sun moved across the sky not because Sefiathan willed it to, but because that's what suns did.

Eventually—because bodies required things—Sefiathan got up. Not with purpose or plan, just because his bladder insisted. He dealt with that, and while he was up, he drank water. And while he was drinking, he noticed he was very hungry. So he ate some dried fruit and hardtack, chewing slowly, tasting properly instead of just fueling.

Then he lay back down and returned to being a plant.

The afternoon brought warmth that made him drowsy. He didn't fight it. Didn't tell himself he needed to stay awake, stay productive, make the most of daylight. He just—slept. Right there in the middle of the day, in actual sunlight, breathing without analyzing his breath.

When he woke, the sun was lower and the stones were singing a different song as the wind shifted. Sefiathan stretched, stood, walked the perimeter of the stone circle without destination. Just moving because his body wanted to move, not because he needed to get somewhere.

His brain felt quieter. Not empty—thoughts still moved through it—but spacious. Like rooms had been cleared of clutter, furniture removed, space opened up for light to move through.

That evening, Sefiathan made dinner with care but without performance. Added foraged greens to his meal because they tasted good, not because it proved he was competent at wilderness survival. Sat by his fire because fire was pleasant, not because it was necessary.

And somewhere in that simple evening—eating food, watching fire, existing without agenda—Sefiathan realized he'd spent an entire day doing nothing productive and felt more rested than he had in years.

His brain had been running overtime for weeks. Today, he'd practiced doing absolutely nothing. And the world hadn't collapsed. Problems hadn't multiplied in his absence. The future hadn't required his constant attention to continue existing.

He'd been a plant. Absorbed sunlight. Emitted oxygen. And that was enough.

As darkness fell and stars appeared through gaps in the stone circle, Sefiathan felt something he rarely allowed himself: contentment that didn't require achievement. Peace that wasn't contingent on productivity. The simple animal pleasure of being alive in a body that worked, in a world that continued without his constant intervention.

Tomorrow he might leave the Singing Stones. Or he might stay another day. Or three. It didn't matter. There was no schedule he was failing to meet, no timeline he was disappointing.

He was a plant, absorbing light, emitting breath.

And that was enough.

His melody came to him as he settled into sleep, but tonight it was barely a hum. Just the sound of air moving through a throat, not trying to be music, not trying to be anything except the sound a living thing made when it was content.

The stones sang their harmony. The wind carried everything.

And Sefiathan, the oddball who loved sideways, learned that sometimes the most productive thing you could do was absolutely nothing at all.
