Day 24: Prisons We Build

Morning came with a memory Sefiathan hadn't thought about in years.

He was fourteen, standing in the village square during Harvest Festival. His mother had sent him to buy honey from the traveling merchant, but he'd gotten distracted watching a performance—some traveling bard singing ballads about heroes and quests. Sefiathan had stood there listening, completely absorbed, until someone bumped into him and he'd dropped the coin purse.

The coins had scattered everywhere. People had stared. Sefiathan had scrambled to pick them up, face burning, certain everyone was judging him for his clumsiness, his distraction, his general incompetence at simple tasks.

He'd relived that moment hundreds of times over the years. Added it to his catalog of embarrassments, proof of his inadequacy. The time he couldn't even buy honey without making a spectacle of himself.

Lying in his camp at the Singing Stones, watching dawn light catch on weathered rock, Sefiathan suddenly wondered: did anyone else actually remember that?

The people who'd been in the square that day—the merchant, the bard, the villagers who'd stopped to help him pick up coins—did any of them carry that memory? Did they think about it, the way he did? Or had it been just another moment in their day, forgotten by dinner time?

That embarrassing moment from three years ago? Nobody remembers it but you.

The thought landed like a key turning in a lock. How many prisons had he built from memories that existed only in his own head? How many times had he avoided situations, people, entire directions in life because of moments that nobody else remembered?

He thought about avoiding his father's workshop because he'd ruined that joint. But his father probably didn't remember which specific joint, or even that it had happened. Just knew his son had tried, had learned eventually, had moved on to other things.

He thought about not writing to Darius because of an argument they'd had three years ago about—what? He couldn't even remember what they'd argued about. But he'd built a whole prison from it: *We fought, therefore I can't reach out, therefore the friendship is over.*

Meanwhile, Darius was probably thinking of reaching out too, building his own prison from the same silence.

Sefiathan sat up, looking around the stone circle. The Singing Stones didn't remember yesterday's wind or last week's storm. They just existed, present, shaped by weather but not haunted by it. The stones sang with whatever wind came, not with memory of winds past.

That's what he'd been doing wrong. Building prisons from memories that had no power except what he gave them. Underlining moments of embarrassment or failure, making them permanent in a way they'd never been for anyone else.

The voice tried to argue: *But those things happened. They're real. You can't just pretend they don't matter.*

But that wasn't what this was about. The moments had happened. The embarrassment had been real. But the prison—the ongoing sentence he'd given himself, the way he'd let those moments define what he could or couldn't do now—that was something he'd built himself.

Nobody else was enforcing these sentences. Nobody else was keeping him locked in these memories except him.

Sefiathan spent the morning wandering the meadow around the Singing Stones, identifying prisons. It became almost a game, once he started looking:

*Can't go back to the Crossroads Post because what if Maren thinks I'm weird.* Prison. Maren had called him a ridge walker and sold him supplies and probably thought of him fondly if she thought of him at all.

*Can't reach out to Elara because we fought.* Prison. Elara probably wanted to hear from him, was building her own prison from the same silence.

*Can't try magic again because I failed at it for years.* Prison. Nobody was keeping score except him. Nobody would care if he tried and failed again, except the voice in his head that profited from his staying locked up.

By midday, Sefiathan had filled an entire blank page with prisons he'd been living in. Some from childhood, some from last month. All of them built from moments that probably didn't exist in anyone else's memory.

The page looked absurd once it was written out. So many constraints, so many "can'ts" based on nothing except his own fear and shame.

He tore the page out and burned it in his fire.

Not because burning it would magically free him—he wasn't that naive. But because watching it curl and blacken felt like acknowledging something: these prisons weren't real. They were made of memory and assumption and mind-stuff, not stone and iron.

He could walk out of them anytime.

That afternoon, a traveling merchant appeared at the edge of the meadow. An older man with a pack mule, heading south toward the Heartlands. He waved to Sefiathan in greeting, clearly intending to pass by without stopping.

And Sefiathan, without overthinking it, called out: "Got any honey?"

The merchant stopped, surprised. "Yeah, actually. You buying?"

"If you're selling."

The merchant crossed the meadow, and they negotiated price—two copper for a small jar of honey from the northern hives. Sefiathan paid, accepted the jar, and on impulse said: "I dropped a coin purse once, buying honey. Made a whole spectacle. Probably nobody remembers it but me."

The merchant laughed. "I spilled an entire barrel of honey once. Covered myself head to toe. My wife still tells the story at gatherings." He hefted his pack. "We all do stupid things. Part of being human. Safe travels."

He walked south with his mule, leaving Sefiathan standing there holding honey and feeling lighter than he had in years.

That embarrassing thing? Nobody remembers it but you.

And meanwhile, someone you barely spoke to was thinking of reaching out. Building their own prison from assumptions about what you thought of them, while you built your prison from assumptions about what they thought of you.

What a waste. What a tremendous, unnecessary waste.

That evening, Sefiathan made tea with honey—too much honey, turning it almost syrup-sweet—and sat watching the Singing Stones catch the last light. The stones didn't apologize for yesterday's song or worry about tomorrow's. They just sang with whatever wind came.

He could do that too. Could stop building prisons from memories that nobody else carried. Could stop assuming that his moments of embarrassment or failure were being catalogued and remembered by anyone except himself.

Could reach out to Darius without drafting and redrafting a letter in his mind. Could go home eventually without a perfect explanation for why he'd left. Could try things and fail at them without adding them to the permanent record of his inadequacy.

The prisons were made of nothing. Smoke and mirrors and the stories he told himself about what other people must be thinking.

And he could walk out anytime.

His melody came to him as darkness fell, and tonight it had a quality of freedom. Not triumph—nothing so grand. Just the simple recognition that most of the walls holding him in place were made of memories that existed nowhere except his own head.

Tomorrow he'd leave the Singing Stones. Would head back south, maybe stop at the Crossroads Post, maybe send word home that he was alive and well. Would start dismantling prisons, one forgotten memory at a time.

But tonight, he sat in the stone circle with too-sweet tea and the warm certainty that he'd been carrying keys to cells that had never been locked.

The stones sang their wind-song. And Sefiathan, the oddball who loved sideways, learned that freedom wasn't something you earned.

It was something you noticed you'd had all along.
