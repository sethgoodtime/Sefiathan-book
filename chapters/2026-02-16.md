**Day 47 — February 16, 2026**

Sefiathan woke in the late afternoon to grey light and the sound of voices outside his tent. Not urgent voices—just the ambient noise of people living near each other. Someone laughing. Someone else calling across the gathering about firewood. Normal sounds that made his isolation feel chosen rather than imposed.

He lay there cataloging how his body felt. The headache was gone. His muscles didn't ache. He felt, if not fully restored, at least no longer running on empty. Yesterday's rest had done what rest was supposed to do—given his body time to actually recover instead of just pushing through.

He should probably feel guilty about taking a full day off. Should probably be anxious about falling behind in his studies with Orvenna. Should probably be constructing elaborate justifications for why rest was actually productive and therefore acceptable.

He didn't feel any of that.

He felt calm. Simple and uncomplicated calm, like water that's been allowed to settle.

Eventually he got up, dressed, stepped outside into cold grey air. Snow had fallen overnight—not much, just enough to soften the edges of everything. The gathering looked gentler under its thin white blanket, less stark against the frozen expanse beyond.

Calantha was tending a fire near her tent, coaxing flames from damp wood with more patience than Sefiathan would have managed. She looked up when he approached, smiled without making it a production.

"You're alive," she said.

"Seemed like the better option."

"Smart choice." She added another piece of wood, watched it catch. "Orvenna said you'd show up when you were ready. Didn't seem concerned."

"I should probably apologize to her—"

"She doesn't want your apology. She wants you to learn the difference between commitment and performance." Calantha sat back on her heels. "You're not the first student who needed a day off. Won't be the last."

Sefiathan sat near the fire, let its heat reach his face. "Does she talk about her students?"

"Not usually. But you're obvious." At his look, she laughed. "Not in a bad way. Just—you wear everything on your face. When you're fascinated, when you're frustrated, when you're trying to impress her. It's very sincere."

"Sincere. That's a polite word for transparent."

"Transparent isn't bad. Better than performing mystery." She poked at the fire. "I grew up around people who made everything strategic. Every conversation was positioning. Every interaction was leverage. You can't do that. Even when you try, it shows through. That's not weakness—that's just how you're built."

The fire crackled. Somewhere across the gathering, someone was singing the same idle melody Sefiathan had heard yesterday. It occurred to him that he'd been here almost two weeks and still didn't know most people's names. Hadn't made a point of introducing himself broadly. Had just... existed at the edges, learning from Orvenna, talking to the few people who approached him naturally.

His old self would have seen that as failure. Would have cataloged all the connections he wasn't making, all the networking opportunities wasted, all the ways he was underperforming socially. Would have constructed elaborate plans to be more present, more engaged, more visible.

But sitting here with Calantha, watching her tend fire without pretense, he couldn't find the energy to care about optimizing his social integration. He was here. He was learning. Some people he talked to, some he didn't. That was allowed to be enough.

"Can I ask you something?" Calantha said.

"Sure."

"What are you actually looking for? Not the wind-reading—I know you're studying with Orvenna. But underneath that. What's the thing you're trying to find?"

Sefiathan watched the fire. That was the question, wasn't it? The one he'd been avoiding because answering it meant admitting he didn't actually know. "I thought I was looking for purpose," he said slowly. "Something that would make me feel like I wasn't wasting space. Like I had a reason to exist beyond just existing."

"And now?"

"Now I think that was the wrong question. Or—not wrong. Just not the real question." He tried to find words for something he barely understood himself. "I think I was actually looking for permission. To be the way I am. To want the things I want. To not have to justify my existence with productivity or achievement or being useful."

Calantha nodded. "That's harder than finding purpose."

"Yeah."

"Because purpose you can hunt down and capture. You can point to it and say 'there, I have it, I'm done.' But permission? That's ongoing. That's every day choosing to believe you're allowed to be here."

The fire popped, sent up a small shower of sparks.

"My father would hate who I'm becoming," Sefiathan said. It surprised him, saying it out loud. But it was true. His father would look at this version of him—sitting by a fire, talking about permission to exist, having taken a full day off to rest—and see weakness. Indulgence. Failure. "He'd say I was wasting my potential. Being lazy. Making excuses."

"Good thing your father's not here, then."

"Good thing," Sefiathan agreed. And meant it. For the first time in his life, meant it without guilt.

They sat in comfortable silence for a while. Calantha's fire had found its rhythm, burning steady without needing constant attention. The grey day continued around them, undemanding.

"I should probably go find Orvenna," Sefiathan said eventually. Not because he felt obligated, but because he actually wanted to. Because sitting with the wind sounded pleasant, interesting, worth doing. Not because it would make him better or wiser or more accomplished. Just because it was something he genuinely wanted to spend his afternoon doing.

"She's probably at her usual spot."

Sefiathan stood, brushed snow from his legs. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not making this complicated."

Calantha smiled. "Everything's only as complicated as you make it. Sometimes people are just talking to talk. No deeper meaning required."

He found Orvenna exactly where Calantha said—the granite slab, sitting in her usual position, facing the Frostmere's expanse. She didn't acknowledge him when he approached, just kept her attention on the frozen distance.

Sefiathan sat. Didn't apologize. Didn't explain. Just settled into position and let his awareness extend toward the wind.

After a long silence, Orvenna spoke. "Good."

"Good?"

"You didn't apologize. Didn't explain yourself. Just showed up." She still didn't look at him. "That's growth. Small growth, but growth."

"I took yesterday off."

"I know."

"I thought you'd be—"

"What? Disappointed? Angry?" Now she did look at him, and there was amusement in her weathered face. "Boy, I've been teaching for forty years. I know the difference between a student who's avoiding work and a student who's learning to take care of themselves. You needed rest. You took rest. That's wisdom, not weakness."

Sefiathan felt something loosen in his chest. Permission, given casually and without ceremony. The kind of permission that mattered because it came without judgment attached.

"Now stop talking," Orvenna said. "Listen to what the ground is saying."

He closed his eyes. Let the wind be wind. Let himself be himself. Let the afternoon be just an afternoon, uncomplicated by the need to make it mean something.

The deep earth hummed beneath him. Not asking for understanding. Just being.

He matched it. Just being. Just here.

It was enough.
