**Day 54 — February 23, 2026**

The next morning, Sefiathan woke to find Petran sitting outside his tent.

Not hovering. Not waiting to pounce. Just sitting there, cross-legged in the frost, looking uncomfortable in a way that suggested he'd been working up to this for a while.

"Can I talk to you?" Petran's voice was quieter than Sefiathan had heard it during Tavis's session. Less certain.

Sefiathan emerged from the tent, still half-asleep, his defenses not yet fully assembled. "About what?"

"About yesterday. About—" Petran stopped. His nervous hands were picking at the edge of his cloak. "About how I was acting during the wind-reading session."

Sefiathan sat down across from him. The morning was grey and still, the kind of cold that felt suspended rather than active. "Alright."

"I know I was—" Petran struggled with the words. "I wasn't trying to be difficult. I genuinely thought I was helping. I've studied with a lot of teachers and they all had these methods, these structures, and Tavis was just—he was doing it differently and I thought maybe he didn't know about the proper ways and I could help him improve and—"

"And you kept offering suggestions," Sefiathan finished.

"Yes." Petran looked miserable. "And then last night someone told me I'd basically hijacked the entire session. That everyone else was frustrated with me. That Tavis looked like he wanted to disappear." He met Sefiathan's eyes. "Was it that bad?"

Sefiathan considered lying. Considered softening it. Considered doing all the things he usually did to make uncomfortable moments easier for everyone involved. But the anger from the past few days was still there, and with it came a different impulse.

To tell the truth. Clearly and directly. Without cruelty but without cushioning.

"Yes," he said. "It was that bad. You interrupted constantly. Every suggestion was basically a criticism of how Tavis teaches. You made it about what you thought should happen instead of letting him lead. And when you say you were trying to help, what you actually mean is you were uncomfortable with his method and wanted him to change it to match what you're familiar with."

Petran flinched. Looked away. His hands were moving faster now, agitated. "That's not—I mean, I wasn't trying to—"

"I know you weren't trying to." Sefiathan kept his voice level. Not harsh, but not gentle either. "Most people who take advantage of someone's generous nature aren't trying to. They genuinely believe they're helping. They've mistaken kindness for weakness and they just keep taking more because the kind person keeps giving."

"I don't—" Petran's voice cracked slightly. "I don't want to be that person."

"Then stop being that person."

The words hung there. Simple and stark. Petran stared at him like he'd expected something different. Expected maybe sympathy, or understanding, or at least a gentle suggestion about how he might improve. Instead he got a flat statement of fact.

"How?" Petran finally asked. "How do I stop?"

"By learning to sit with your discomfort instead of immediately trying to fix it by making someone else change." Sefiathan thought about Calantha's words about naming the fear. About the worst thing. "When you see someone doing something differently than you're used to, your first instinct is to correct them. To explain the 'right' way. To offer suggestions. What you're actually doing is trying to make your own discomfort with difference go away by making them more like what you know."

"But what if they actually don't know? What if there is a better way?"

"Then they'll figure it out. Or they won't. Either way, it's not your job to rescue them from their own choices." Sefiathan felt the clarity of his own anger making everything sharp and precise. "You want to help. Fine. But helping means respecting someone's right to do things their own way. Not taking over their process because you're uncomfortable watching them stumble."

Petran was quiet for a long time. Around them, the gathering was beginning its morning routines—fires being tended, breakfast being prepared, the low murmur of conversation. Normal life happening while this particular conversation carved its space.

"I used to have a teacher," Petran said eventually. "Master Erithon. He was brilliant. Structured. He had a method for everything. Clear progressions. Specific techniques. Learning from him felt like—like building a house with perfect plans. Everything had its place. Everything made sense."

"And Tavis doesn't teach like that," Sefiathan said.

"No. He just—he jumps around. Follows tangents. Adjusts on the fly based on what people seem to need in the moment. It looks chaotic to me. Improvised. Like he's making it up as he goes."

"Maybe he is."

"But that's not—" Petran stopped. "That's not how teaching is supposed to work."

"According to Master Erithon."

"According to—" Petran paused. Something shifted in his expression. "According to what I learned. What I know works."

"For you." Sefiathan let the distinction settle. "What works for you. What makes you comfortable. What matches your idea of how learning should look. But Tavis's students were learning fine until you convinced yourself they needed to be rescued from his chaos."

Petran's hands had gone still. He was staring at the frozen ground between them like reading text written there. "I've been doing this for years, haven't I? Going into situations and immediately seeing what's wrong with them. What needs to be fixed. What could be better if they just did it the way I know works."

"Probably."

"And people just—they put up with it. Because it's framed as helping. As offering perspective. As wanting the best for them."

"Yes." Sefiathan thought about all the times he'd accommodated exactly this kind of behavior. Smiled and nodded and considered whether maybe they were right. Maybe he should change. Maybe his way wasn't good enough. "It's a clever kind of control. Makes the person being controlled feel like they should be grateful for it."

"I don't want to control anyone."

"Then stop offering suggestions unless someone explicitly asks for them. Stop seeing difference as a problem to fix. Stop treating your way as the obviously correct way that others just haven't learned yet." Sefiathan softened slightly, recognizing something in Petran's misery that resonated with his own history. "The hardest part isn't stopping the behavior. It's sitting with the discomfort that made you do it in the first place. Watching someone do something differently than you would and just—letting them. Not rescuing them. Not correcting them. Just letting them be different."

"That sounds terrible."

"It is." Sefiathan almost smiled. "You have to feel uncomfortable and not immediately try to make it stop. Most people can't do it. They'd rather take over someone else's process than sit with their own anxiety about difference."

Petran nodded slowly. Looked at Sefiathan with something like recognition. "You're angry about this. Not just about yesterday. About something bigger."

"Yes."

"At someone specific?"

"At everyone who ever treated my differences as problems to fix." The words came easier now. Clearer. "At my father who wanted me to be more like him. At everyone who offered 'helpful suggestions' about how I could be more normal, more capable, more like what they thought I should be. At myself for listening to them."

"I'm sorry," Petran said quietly.

"Don't be sorry. Just stop doing it." Sefiathan stood, the conversation feeling complete. "Tavis is teaching another session this afternoon. You're welcome to come. But if you do, you need to actually let him teach. No suggestions. No corrections. No helpful perspective. Just—watch. Learn if you can. Or don't come if you can't handle sitting with how different it is from what you're used to."

"And if I have a question?"

"Save it for after. Ask Tavis privately if he wants feedback. Let him decide if your perspective is useful to him instead of assuming it is."

Petran nodded. Looked smaller somehow. More uncertain. But also more honest. "Thank you," he said. "For not—for not being nice about this."

"You're welcome."

Sefiathan walked away feeling something solid settle in his chest. The anger was still there but it had done something useful. Had been clear and direct and uncompromising without being cruel. Had drawn a line that needed drawing.

It was okay to say no. To refuse to accommodate. To tell someone directly that their behavior was a problem instead of gently suggesting they might consider possibly trying to maybe do things differently.

The people who took advantage kept taking because kind people kept giving. Kept accommodating. Kept treating their own boundaries as negotiable in the name of being understanding.

Sometimes you had to draw the line. Had to say no clearly and directly. Had to let someone be uncomfortable with your answer instead of immediately trying to soften it.

The worst thing that could happen if you didn't draw the line was that they'd keep crossing it. Keep taking more. Keep mistaking your kindness for weakness. Keep growing bolder while you grew smaller.

Sefiathan had been that kind person his whole life. Always accommodating. Always understanding. Always giving more until there was nothing left to give.

But he was learning. Slowly. Painfully. That saying no was not cruelty. That protecting his space was not selfishness. That sometimes the most honest thing you could do for someone was refuse to keep enabling their comfort at your expense.

It was okay to say no.

He was still learning to believe it.
