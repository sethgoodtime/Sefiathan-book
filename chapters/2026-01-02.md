Day 2: The Crossroads

The humming had stopped by midday.

Sefiathan's throat was dry, his head still tender from the wine, and the initial inspiration of the morning had faded into the practical realities of being alone on a forest road with three copper coins and no particular destination. The path had widened somewhat, showing more signs of travel—wheel ruts from carts, the occasional horse dropping, a discarded clay pipe shattered in the dust.

He was trying to coax his melody back, to recapture that feeling of purpose, when he heard voices ahead.

"—absolutely not listening to me," a high, sharp voice was saying. "Nobody ever listens. I could be saying the most important thing in the history of things, and you'd all just—"

"Shut it, Mikken." This voice was deeper, tired. "We heard you the first six times."

Sefiathan slowed his pace. The forest opened ahead into a proper crossroads, where his northward path intersected with what looked like a more established east-west route. A weathered signpost stood at the junction, pointing to places whose names meant nothing to him: Kethril to the west, Greymark to the east, something called the Underturn to the south. North, his direction, simply read "Wildlands - Travel at own peril."

Gathered around the signpost were three figures that could only charitably be called travelers.

The first was a wiry man perched on a boulder, his clothes an assault of mismatched fabrics—velvet sleeves, a leather vest, canvas trousers, and a scarf that might once have been expensive but was now mostly holes. He wore at least five rings on each hand and was in the process of attempting to juggle three stones, badly. This, Sefiathan guessed, was Mikken.

"I'm just saying," Mikken continued, dropping one of the stones, "that if we'd gone east like I suggested yesterday, we'd have been in Greymark by now, warm beds, hot food, maybe even a bit of entertainment, but no, no, we had to follow your 'instinct' and look where—oh, hello!"

He'd spotted Sefiathan.

The second figure looked up from where he'd been crouched, examining something on the ground. He was human, probably in his forties, with the weathered face of someone who'd spent years outdoors and the build of someone who'd done hard labor. He wore practical traveling clothes and carried what looked like a hunting bow across his back. His eyes assessed Sefiathan quickly—noting the lack of obvious weapons, the shabby pack, the general air of someone who wasn't quite a threat—and dismissed him just as quickly.

"Morning," the man said neutrally.

The third figure didn't look up at all. She sat with her back against the signpost, knees drawn up, hood pulled low over her face. All Sefiathan could see were her hands—pale, long-fingered, clutching what appeared to be a small glass orb that she turned over and over in her palms. Something about her stillness made him nervous.

"Morning," Sefiathan managed, suddenly aware of how rough he must look. He tried to smooth his hair down, felt bark crumble out of it. "I'm just... passing through."

"Aren't we all," Mikken said cheerfully, finally giving up on the juggling. "Passing through, passing by, passing into new and exciting disasters. I'm Mikken of... well, of nowhere in particular anymore, and these cheerful companions are Torval"—he gestured to the weathered man—"and our perpetually delightful friend who refuses to share her name."

"I shared it," the hooded figure said quietly. Her voice had an odd quality, like two notes played almost but not quite in harmony. "You forgot it."

"I didn't forget it, I'm simply respectfully waiting for you to reintroduce yourself since we're clearly doing introductions."

"We're not doing introductions," Torval said. "The boy's passing through."

But Sefiathan found himself rooted in place, not by the juggler or the hunter, but by the hooded woman and her turning glass orb. There was something hypnotic about the movement, the way the light caught in the sphere and refracted strangely, creating colors that didn't quite exist.

"What are you looking for?" he heard himself ask.

All three travelers turned to look at him with varying expressions of surprise.

"What makes you think we're looking for something?" Torval asked.

"You're at a crossroads with a map spread out"—Sefiathan nodded to the piece of parchment on the ground near Torval—"arguing about directions, and she's"—he pointed at the hooded woman—"turning that orb like it's supposed to tell her something. Everyone at a crossroads is looking for something. Or running from something. Or both."

Mikken let out a delighted laugh. "Oh, he's clever! I like him. Can we keep him?"

"We're not keeping anyone," Torval said, but there was something less dismissive in his tone now. He studied Sefiathan more carefully. "You're right, though. We're... seeking information. About someone who passed through here."

"Who?"

"No one you'd know."

"How do you know what I know?"

The hooded woman stopped turning her orb. She lifted her head slightly, and though Sefiathan still couldn't see her face clearly, he felt the weight of her attention like a physical thing.

"He's confused," she said in that strange, harmonious voice. "His song is incomplete. He doesn't know which direction to walk because he doesn't know what he's walking toward."

The words hit too close. Sefiathan felt suddenly exposed, as if she'd reached into his chest and pulled out the ugly, uncertain truth of his situation. He wanted to protest, to tell her she was wrong, but she wasn't wrong at all. He hummed in the morning and walked without purpose. He'd left home with a vague intention and less than four coins.

"My song's fine," he said, but it came out defensive, childish.

"No," the woman said, not unkindly. "But you're trying to find it. That's something."

There was a moment of uncomfortable silence. Sefiathan wanted to leave, to continue north, to put this strange encounter behind him. But he also wanted—desperately, suddenly—to know who these people were, what they were seeking, why a woman with a mystical orb was reading his intentions like a book.

Torval must have seen something in his face because his expression softened slightly. "Look, boy—"

"Sefiathan."

"Sefiathan. You seem like you're on some kind of journey, and that's fine, that's your business. But we're looking for someone specific, and our business is... complicated. Probably best if you just pick a direction and keep moving."

It was sensible advice. Everything about this situation told Sefiathan to be cautious, to preserve his solitude, to not get entangled in other people's complicated business when he had his own mess to sort through.

But then he remembered the bird. The impossible, ugly bird singing its impossible song.

Maybe the song didn't come from planning. Maybe it came from saying yes to unexpected encounters. Maybe you found your melody by accident, at crossroads, in conversation with juggling strangers and hooded mystics.

"I'm going north," Sefiathan said. "Into the Wildlands. If your person went that way, I could... keep an eye out. I don't know many people, so I'd notice strangers."

Mikken's eyes lit up. "See? See? I told you we should bring someone else! I said it would be—"

"We're not bringing anyone," Torval said firmly, but his eyes were calculating, weighing something. He looked at the hooded woman. "What do you think?"

She was silent for a long moment, turning her orb again, watching the light play through it. Then: "He could walk with us for a day. We're all going north anyway. If he wants to ask for help, he should learn how to ask directly instead of offering tentative bargains."

Sefiathan felt his face flush. She was right again, cutting through his attempt at manipulation to the vulnerable truth underneath. He didn't want to walk alone. He wanted company, guidance, someone to support his head while he figured out how to stand on his own. But asking for help felt like admitting weakness, like confirming he was the lost, purposeless thing his sister thought he was.

"I'd like to travel with you," he said, forcing himself to be direct. "For a day or two. I don't know this area, and I'd appreciate the company. I don't have much to offer in return."

It was harder to say than it should have been.

Torval and Mikken exchanged looks. Then Torval sighed, the sound of a man accepting something against his better judgment.

"One day," he said. "We walk north to the village of Raskell. That's maybe eight hours at a steady pace. We camp there for the night, and in the morning you go your way and we go ours. You carry your own gear, don't slow us down, and you don't ask questions about our business. Agreed?"

It wasn't the warm welcome Sefiathan might have hoped for, but it was something. It was company. It was a direction that someone else had chosen, which meant he could stop the endless internal debate about whether north was right or if he should have gone east or west or back home entirely.

"Agreed," he said.

Mikken clapped his hands together, rings clinking. "Excellent! This will be much less boring now. Do you have any talents, Sefiathan? Can you juggle? Tell jokes? Read ancient runes? Predict the weather? Speak to animals?"

"No," Sefiathan admitted.

"Perfect! You can listen to me practice then. I've been working on this new routine where I juggle while telling a story, except the objects I'm juggling represent different characters in the story, so when I drop one it means that character has died, which creates this delightful dramatic tension—"

"Nobody wants to hear about your juggling," Torval said, but without heat. He was already folding up his map, preparing to move. "Let's go. We're burning daylight."

The hooded woman stood in one fluid motion, pocketing her orb. She moved past Sefiathan, and for just a moment he glimpsed her face beneath the hood—young, pale as moonlight, with eyes that held flecks of silver like stars. Then she was past him, walking north on the path, and he wasn't certain he'd seen anything at all.

Sefiathan adjusted his pack and fell into step behind them, Mikken chattering beside him about the proper weight distribution for successful story-juggling, Torval silent and watchful ahead.

He was still walking north. He still didn't know where he was going or what he hoped to find. His song was still incomplete, probably would be for a long while yet.

But he wasn't walking alone anymore.

That felt like enough for Day Two.
