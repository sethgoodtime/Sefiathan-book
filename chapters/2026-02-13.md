**Day 44 — February 13, 2026**

Sefiathan found Tavis at the edge of the gathering, sitting on a flat rock overlooking the frozen expanse. Not hiding, exactly. Just away from people. The sun was bright enough to hurt, reflecting off ice in a thousand directions. Sefiathan had to squint to see properly.

"Can I sit?" he asked.

Tavis shrugged without looking at him. Sefiathan took that as permission and settled onto the cold stone, leaving space between them.

For a while neither of them spoke. The wind moved across the ice making sounds like distant conversation. Sefiathan rehearsed apologies in his head, discarded them, rehearsed more. None of them sounded right. They all sounded like performances—things you say because you're supposed to say them, not because you mean them.

"I was an ass yesterday," he finally said.

"Yeah."

"I knew exactly where to hit to make it hurt. And I did it anyway."

"Yeah." Tavis picked up a small stone, turned it over in his hands. "Why?"

Sefiathan breathed out. This was the part that made his chest tight. Not the apology—that was easy, that was script. This was the real question underneath, the one that mattered. "Because I was right," he said. "And I needed you to know it. Needed to win so badly that I didn't care what it cost."

Tavis nodded slowly. "I do that too," he said. "The notation thing. The optimization thing. I know I do it. Korrin's told me. My cousin told me. Before I burned those pages, I knew they were ridiculous. But I had to prepare them anyway because not being useful feels like disappearing." He threw the stone. It skittered across the ice, soundless at this distance. "So yeah. You were right. But you were also a dick about it."

"I know."

They sat with that. A bird—some northern species Sefiathan didn't recognize—wheeled overhead, making high sharp cries.

"My father used to do that," Sefiathan said. "What I did yesterday. He'd listen to me talk about something I cared about, and then he'd find the flaw. The weak point in the argument. And he'd press on it until I either gave up or fought back. And if I fought back, I'd lost—because getting emotional meant I couldn't defend my position with logic." He watched the bird circle. "I swore I'd never do that to anyone. And then yesterday I did exactly that to you."

"Because you learned how," Tavis said. "That's how you survived your house. You learned to fight the way he fought."

Sefiathan felt something crack open in his chest. "I don't want to be like him."

"So don't be." Tavis finally looked at him. His eyes were red-rimmed but dry. "You already apologized. That's further than he'd go, I'm guessing."

"He'd find a way to make the apology itself a weapon."

"Yeah. My father did that too. 'I'm sorry you felt hurt by what I said' instead of 'I'm sorry I said something hurtful.'" Tavis smiled, bitter. "Funny how they all read from the same book."

The bird landed on the ice far below them, pecked at something invisible, took off again. Just living its life. Not performing for anyone.

"I've been thinking about what you said," Tavis continued. "About me needing to be useful. And you're right. I do. I walk into every situation looking for the problem I can solve because that's how I prove I deserve to be there. And it's exhausting. It's—" He gestured helplessly. "I can't just be. I have to justify my presence with productivity."

"That's not the same as what I accused you of," Sefiathan said. "I made it sound like you were this arrogant ass who thought everyone else was doing everything wrong. But that's not what I saw. I saw someone who's scared of being useless. And instead of saying that, I went for the throat."

"Why?"

The question hung there. Sefiathan watched the ice, the light, the empty horizon.

"Because it's easier than looking at myself," he said slowly. "You were being annoying—genuinely annoying—but that's not why I attacked you. I attacked you because you reminded me of me. The way I can't let things be imperfect. The way I have to perform competence so people won't see how terrified I am that I don't actually deserve to be here."

Tavis was quiet for a long time. "We're both doing the same thing," he said eventually. "Just in different directions. I have to be needed. You have to be right. Both of us trying to earn our place instead of just taking it."

"Yeah."

"That's kind of sad."

"Yeah."

They sat there in the cold bright morning, two people who'd hurt each other because they were both terrified of the same thing—being seen as they actually were and found lacking.

"I'm sorry," Sefiathan said again. "Not because I want you to forgive me. Just because I genuinely regret being cruel."

"I know." Tavis stood, brushed ice crystals off his trousers. "I'm still mad at you. But I also get it. And I'm sorry too. For being exhausting. For trying to optimize everyone's traditions."

"You're allowed to be interested in how things work."

"I'm allowed to be interested without making it a referendum on whether they're doing it right."

Sefiathan stood too. They faced each other, and there was something different now—not fixed, exactly. Not solved. But honest. Real in a way that hurt less than the performance had.

"We're probably going to annoy each other again," Tavis said.

"Definitely."

"Can we just... say it? Instead of storing it up for a fight?"

"I can try." Sefiathan managed a small smile. "I'm not good at it yet. But I can try."

They walked back to the gathering together, and Sefiathan felt the familiar urge to replay the conversation, to scan for whether he'd done it right, whether Tavis still hated him, whether he'd won or lost this interaction. But underneath that—quieter, steadier—was something else. The simple fact of having been honest. Of having stopped performing long enough to be seen.

It didn't erase what he'd done. But it was a start.
