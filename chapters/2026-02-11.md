**Day 42 — February 11, 2026**

Sefiathan spent the morning avoiding people.

Not dramatically. Not in a way anyone would notice. He just happened to take his breakfast back to the tent instead of eating by the communal fire. Happened to time his walk to Orvenna's perch for when most people were occupied elsewhere. Happened to choose a route that didn't cross paths with Korrin or Tavis or Calantha or anyone who might look at him and see yesterday's rawness still visible on his face.

He was allowed to do that. Allowed to have shown up, sung his song, sat with Orvenna's terrifying observations about love, and then take a day to not be perceived while he processed it all. That was reasonable. That was fine.

Except it wasn't processing. It was the old familiar spiral: replaying every interaction from the past few days, scanning for evidence that he'd revealed too much, that people had seen something in him they found lacking. The way Maren had looked right through him, not even registering his presence. The way Orvenna had named his love "disastrous" like it was fact, like everyone could see it, like he was walking around with his heart hanging outside his chest for anyone to judge.

He sat on the granite slab and tried to be still, but his thoughts were loud enough to drown out continents.

Orvenna didn't open her eyes. "You're doing the thing again."

"What thing?"

"Trying to fix their version of you." She breathed out slow. "Someone looked at you sideways, or didn't look at all, and now you're excavating the interaction for evidence of your fundamental wrongness."

Sefiathan's face burned. "I'm not—"

"You are. You've been here an hour and I can hear you thinking from here." She opened one eye. "What happened?"

"Nothing happened. I just..." He gestured helplessly at the air, at himself, at everything. "What if you're wrong? About the love thing. What if it's not disastrous in some romantic, noble way. What if it's just pathetic. What if I'm one of those people who loves too hard at the wrong people and everyone can see it except me."

"Like Maren."

"I didn't say that."

"You didn't have to." Orvenna shifted, settling deeper into stillness. "You saw a man grieving and recognized yourself in it. The desperation. The hanging on. And now you're terrified that's who you are—someone who can't let go, someone whose love is burden instead of gift."

Yes. Exactly that. Though hearing it said aloud made it sound more theatrical than it felt in his chest.

"Here's what I know," Orvenna said. "Maren's wife didn't leave because he loved her. She left because he couldn't see her past his idea of her. He was so busy loving the version of her he'd built in his head that he forgot to notice who she actually was. That's not too much love. That's not enough attention to the right things."

"How do you know that?"

"Because she told me before she left. Came here asking if the wind could carry a message to him. I said no, she'd have to deliver it herself. She said she'd tried. He didn't hear her." Orvenna's voice was flat, factual. "You want to know the difference between love that opens and love that suffocates? One pays attention to the person in front of them. The other pays attention to their fear of losing the person in front of them."

Sefiathan sat with that. The ice hummed below. His mind wanted to make it a test—how do you know which one you're doing, how do you prove you're paying attention to the right things, what if you get it wrong—but he caught himself before the spiral fully launched.

"You're not responsible for someone else's version of you," Orvenna said. "Not your father's disappointment. Not Mira's indifference. Not whoever in Millhaven decided you were too much or not enough. Their criticism is about their fears, not your flaws. And trying to fix their twisted mirror just means you're doing their work for them."

"So I just... stop caring what people think?"

"I didn't say that." She almost smiled. "I said stop trying to manage their perception. Let them hold whatever warped image they want. You don't have to stand in front of it posing until they get you right. You can just walk away."

A crow landed on the ice nearby, cocked its head at them, then took off again without ceremony. Just a crow doing crow things, unburdened by what anyone thought about its crow-ness.

"I don't know how to do that," Sefiathan said.

"Yes you do. You did it last night when you sang your imperfect song and didn't apologize for it. You did it yesterday when you sat here terrified and didn't run." Orvenna opened both eyes, looked at him fully. "You're doing it right now by admitting you don't know instead of pretending you've figured it out."

Sefiathan breathed. The cold air stung his lungs. Under the ice, that deep presence pulsed—steady, unbothered, entirely itself regardless of whether anyone was listening.

He thought about his father, probably in his workshop right now, building something. Holding some version of Sefiathan in his mind that had nothing to do with who Sefiathan actually was. And how exhausting it had been, all those years, trying to reshape himself to match that imagined son. Trying to fix what was never actually broken.

What if he just... let his father keep that image? Let it be his father's problem? What if the work wasn't to change his father's mind, but to stop contorting himself trying?

"It feels selfish," he said.

"Good," Orvenna said, and closed her eyes again. "Your life is yours to be selfish with."
