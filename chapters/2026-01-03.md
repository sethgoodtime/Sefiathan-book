Day 3: The Weight of Stories

They walked until the sun reached its apex and began its slow descent toward evening. Sefiathan's initial relief at having company gradually transformed into something more complicated as he learned the rhythm of traveling with others.

Mikken, it turned out, was incapable of silence for more than three consecutive minutes. He narrated their journey like a bard performing for an invisible audience, pointing out interesting trees ("That's a Widow Oak—see how the branches droop? Supposedly they only grow where someone's been hanged, but I think that's nonsense since I've seen them in forests nowhere near roads"), unusual cloud formations ("Dragon-shaped! Or possibly a very fat horse. Torval, would you say dragon or horse?"), and his own stream-of-consciousness thoughts on everything from boot construction to the declining quality of tavern stew in the northern territories.

Torval responded to perhaps one in every ten of Mikken's observations, usually with a grunt or a single word. He walked with the steady, economical gait of someone who'd spent years covering ground, his attention constantly scanning the forest around them. Twice he held up a hand to stop them, listening to something Sefiathan couldn't hear, before nodding and continuing on.

The hooded woman—who still hadn't shared her name—walked in her own pocket of silence, somehow separate from the group even while among them. She moved with an odd grace, her feet seeming to find the smoothest path without looking down. Occasionally she would pull out her glass orb and turn it in her palm, watching the light play through it, before putting it away again.

By mid-afternoon, Sefiathan's initial gratitude was warring with a growing sense of inadequacy. These people moved with purpose. They knew how to walk without wasting energy, where to step to avoid roots and rocks, when to drink water and when to push on. They belonged to the road in a way he didn't.

"You're overthinking," the hooded woman said suddenly, dropping back to walk beside him. 

Sefiathan startled. She'd barely spoken since they'd started walking. "What?"

"Your thoughts. They're very loud." She glanced at him, those strange silver-flecked eyes catching the dappled sunlight through the trees. "You're comparing yourself to us. Deciding you don't measure up. Wondering if we regret letting you join. Creating elaborate stories about your own inadequacy."

It was so accurate that Sefiathan felt momentarily dizzy. "Can you read minds?"

"No. But I can read the shapes people make when they think. The way they hold their shoulders, the rhythm of their breathing, the small flinches and corrections." She paused. "You're very loud. Your entire body is apologizing for existing."

"That's..." Sefiathan wanted to argue, but couldn't. She was right. Again. He'd spent the entire day trying to take up as little space as possible, to be unobtrusive, to prove he wasn't a burden. "How do I make it quieter?"

"Why would you want to?"

"Because it's... I don't know. Weak? Annoying?"

The woman made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been something else. "Everyone's thoughts are loud when they're trying to figure out who they are. The problem isn't the volume. The problem is you're listening to the wrong story."

"What story should I be listening to?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" She pulled out her orb again, held it up so the light streamed through it in strange, prismatic patterns. "Most people go their whole lives stuck in one version of events, one interpretation of who they are. They make themselves small by choosing small stories. Failure stories. Victim stories. Stories where they're the sidekick in someone else's adventure."

Sefiathan felt something twist in his chest. "So what's the alternative?"

"Tell several different stories. Hold multiple truths at once. You're both the person who woke up hungover in the mud and the person who heard a bird sing. Both the person who has no idea what they're doing and the person who's brave enough to walk into the Wildlands anyway. Both/and, not either/or."

Mikken, who had apparently been eavesdropping, turned around to walk backwards while he talked. "Oh, she's doing her philosophy thing! She does this. Gets all cryptic and profound and then refuses to explain further. Drives Torval absolutely mad."

"I'm not being cryptic," the woman said. "I'm being precise. Words matter. The stories we tell about ourselves matter. If Sefiathan here decides he's worthless, that becomes true. If he decides he's on a journey toward something, that becomes true instead. Both stories use the same facts."

"So I should just... lie to myself?" Sefiathan asked. "Pretend I'm something I'm not?"

"You're doing that already. You're pretending to be small. I'm suggesting you pretend to be multiple things at once and see which pretending feels more alive."

Torval, still walking ahead, spoke without turning around. "Enough with the orb-wisdom. We're not adopting this kid as some kind of project."

"I'm not a kid," Sefiathan said, more sharply than he intended. "I'm twenty-seven."

"Then act like it," Torval said. "Stop waiting for someone to tell you it's okay to take up space."

The words stung, but they also clarified something. Sefiathan had been walking like he needed permission—permission to speak, to rest, to be part of the group. But no one had made him ask for permission except himself.

"Can I ask you something?" Sefiathan said to the woman. "Your orb. What does it actually do?"

She smiled, the expression transforming her pale face. "Now that's a better question. It shows possibilities. Alternative paths. The different stories events could tell." She held it up again. "Right now, it's showing me three versions of this conversation. In one, you get angry at Torval's bluntness and storm off. In another, you take his words as confirmation of your worst fears and withdraw into yourself. In the third..."

"What happens in the third?"

"You accept that you're allowed to be messy and contradictory and still valuable. You keep walking. You let your song stay incomplete for a while longer without deciding it means you're broken."

Sefiathan looked at the orb, trying to see what she saw, but it just looked like glass refracting light. "Which version will happen?"

"That's up to you. The orb doesn't predict. It just shows what's possible." She tucked it away. "Most people never realize how many different stories they could be telling. They pick one—usually the worst one—and defend it like it's the only truth."

They walked in silence for a while after that. The forest was beginning to thin, suggesting they were approaching clearer land. Somewhere ahead, Sefiathan knew, was the village of Raskell where they'd camp for the night. Tomorrow he'd be on his own again, walking north into the Wildlands with no clear destination and no company.

But right now, in this moment, he was walking with three strangers who'd let him join them. He was carrying his own pack and keeping pace. He was learning how to notice the subtle signals that indicated water nearby or rocky ground ahead. He was both competent and incompetent, both brave and terrified, both purposeful and lost.

Maybe that was okay. Maybe that was enough.

"Thank you," he said to the woman. "For the... orb-wisdom, as Torval called it."

She glanced at him, those silver-flecked eyes unreadable. "You're welcome. But remember—I can't tell you which story to choose. That's your work. I can just show you that there are always more stories available than the one you're telling yourself."

"What's your story?" Sefiathan asked. "Why are you traveling with these two? What are you looking for?"

The woman's expression shuttered. "That," she said quietly, "is a story I'm still trying to understand myself. Ask me again in a month. Or a year. Maybe by then I'll know which version is true."

She walked ahead, rejoining Torval, leaving Sefiathan with Mikken who immediately launched into a story about a time he'd juggled at a wedding and accidentally set the bride's veil on fire with a torch, which led to a series of increasingly improbable events involving a stolen horse, a very angry baker, and three chickens.

Sefiathan only half-listened. He was too busy thinking about multiple stories, about the space between either/or and both/and, about birds that couldn't fly but sang anyway.

His melody was still incomplete. But maybe that was fine. Maybe songs didn't arrive fully formed. Maybe you built them note by note, day by day, accumulating small moments of clarity at crossroads and on forest paths.

Maybe the point wasn't to have it all figured out. Maybe the point was just to keep walking, to keep listening, to stay open to the unexpected conversations that taught you something about which story you wanted to tell.

Sefiathan hummed a few notes—still searching, still uncertain, but perhaps a bit more intentional than before.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

And today, something felt like enough.
