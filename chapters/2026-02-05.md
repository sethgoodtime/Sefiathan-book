Day 36 — February 5, 2026

Calantha found him before breakfast, while he was still crouched by the fire pit trying to coax heat from last night's embers. She dropped an armload of dried reed bundles beside him without asking and sat down on the opposite stone.

"You don't have to do that alone," she said. Not gently, not harshly. Just factually, the way someone might say *the river runs south*.

Sefiathan opened his mouth to say he didn't mind, that he was used to it, that it was no trouble — and then closed it again. Because the truth was his fingers were numb and the tinder was damp and he'd been kneeling here for ten minutes producing nothing but smoke and frustration.

"Thank you," he said instead.

She showed him the reed trick — splitting the dry centers, building a nest of fiber that caught on the first spark. He'd been using the whole stalks, wasting effort on their tough outer bark. It was such a small thing. But watching her hands work, he felt something old and familiar tighten in his chest: the reflex to memorize, to owe, to calculate how he'd repay this minor kindness so the ledger stayed balanced.

He'd been doing it his whole life, he realized. Keeping accounts. Every bowl of soup someone offered, every warm place by a fire, every moment of patience someone showed him — he'd logged it all as debt. And he'd been paying it back with a kind of relentless, exhausting generosity that never felt like enough because the repayment was the point, not the giving.

The fire caught. Calantha held her hands over it without ceremony.

"Can I ask you something?" Sefiathan said.

"You just did."

"Do you ever feel like — like you're always performing? Being useful, being generous, being the one who helps, and it's not that you don't want to help, but sometimes you can't tell anymore whether you're doing it because you want to or because you're terrified of what happens if you stop?"

Calantha looked at him for a long moment. The firelight made her dark eyes liquid. "Every wind-reader I know came here running from some version of that question," she said. "Most of them were the person everyone else leaned on. The reliable one. The one who listened." She poked a reed into the fire and watched it curl. "You know what the Frostmere teaches, if you let it?"

He shook his head.

"That needing things isn't a weakness. It's a requirement. Like breathing." She stood, brushing ash from her knees. "The gathering starts the sharing circle after the second meal. You should come. But only if you actually want to. Not because you think you should."

She walked away and left him sitting with the fire, which was burning well now, generously, without being asked.

Korrin and Tavis joined him later. Tavis had found some kind of salted fish at a trader's tent and was eating it with the uncomplicated pleasure of someone who'd stopped apologizing for having appetites. Korrin stood with his face tilted toward the pale morning sun, eyes closed.

"I've been thinking," Sefiathan said, "about how much I give away."

"Food?" Tavis asked through a mouthful of fish.

"Everything. Attention, time, energy. And I think I've been doing it so people won't notice I need things too." He paused. "Or so I won't have to notice."

Korrin opened one eye. "What do you need?"

The question landed like a stone in still water. Sefiathan sat with the ripples. What did he need? Not want, not should-have, not what-would-be-nice. Need, the way fire needs air.

"I need people to ask me that," he said slowly, "and mean it. And I need to stop pretending the answer is nothing."

Tavis offered him a piece of fish. Sefiathan took it.

It was good.
