**Day 58 — February 27, 2026**

Sefiathan spent the morning deliberately alone. Not hiding—he was past that kind of retreat—but choosing solitude with intention. After yesterday's confrontation with Tavis, he needed space that wasn't occupied by other people's expectations or reactions or carefully managed hurt feelings.

He found a spot near the eastern edge of the gathering where the frozen ground gave way to a cluster of bare birch trees. The white bark caught the thin winter light in a way that felt clean, uncomplicated. He sat with his back against one of the trunks and let the cold seep through his cloak into his spine.

The thing about drawing hard lines with people was that you couldn't control what happened after. Tavis had walked away angry and hurt. Other people had probably noticed. By now there were likely conversations happening—about what Sefiathan had said, whether he'd been too harsh, whether Tavis deserved that kind of bluntness. The social ripples spreading outward from a moment of unfiltered truth.

The old Sefiathan would be spinning right now. Would be mentally rehearsing apologies or explanations. Would be seeking out mutual friends to clarify his intentions, to make sure everyone understood he wasn't trying to be cruel. Would be looking for validation that he'd done the right thing, or preparing to accept blame if he'd done the wrong thing.

But sitting here against the birch tree, Sefiathan realized he didn't actually care what most people thought about it. Didn't need their validation. Didn't need them to understand his reasoning or agree with his approach. He'd said what he needed to say to Tavis. The rest—how Tavis processed it, how others interpreted it, what the broader social consensus became—wasn't his to control or fix.

He already knew what he needed. The Co-Star prompt came back to him sideways: instead of looking for validation from romantic interests, try to give that to yourself. But it wasn't just about romance. It was about seeking confirmation from anyone outside himself that he'd done it right, said it right, been right. The constant checking for approval. The shape-shifting to meet other people's shifting expectations.

He'd spent his whole life doing that. Contorting himself to be what others needed so they'd validate that he had value. With his father, it was trying to be practical and capable. With his mother, trying to be content and uncomplicated. With Mira, trying to be gracious about being replaced. With everyone, trying to prove he was good enough by being whatever version of himself they'd find most acceptable.

And it had left him hollow. Not because any single person had failed him, but because seeking validation from external sources meant he'd never developed his own internal sense of worth. He'd outsourced his self-concept to whoever happened to be watching.

Tavis had accused him of not being patient enough. Of abandoning him when it got inconvenient. Of being just like everyone else who didn't really understand struggle. And part of Sefiathan—the old part—wanted desperately to prove Tavis wrong. To show that he did understand, that he was patient, that he wasn't abandoning anyone.

But sitting here in the cold, Sefiathan realized that was just more seeking. More looking for someone else to tell him he was doing it right. And Tavis's version of "right" required Sefiathan to keep fixing his problems, to keep enabling his helplessness, to keep performing care through exhaustion.

That wasn't validation. That was just another expectation to contort himself around.

The birch bark was smooth under his palm, slightly papery. He thought about the trees budding early near the sharing circle. The way things grew when they were ready, not when someone else decided they should. The way validation that came from external sources always required maintaining the performance that earned it.

He didn't want to perform anymore. Didn't want to keep seeking confirmation that he was allowed to take up space, allowed to have boundaries, allowed to say hard things without immediately softening them. He wanted to just—know. To have his own internal compass that pointed toward what he needed without constantly checking whether everyone else agreed it was the right direction.

A sound made him look up. Calantha was approaching, moving carefully over the uneven frozen ground. She stopped a few paces away, reading his body language with the same attention she brought to wind patterns.

"Can I sit, or are you peopled out?"

"You can sit." Sefiathan shifted slightly to make room. "I'm not hiding. Just choosing space."

She settled beside him, not quite touching but close enough that he could feel her warmth in the cold air. "People are talking about what happened with Tavis."

"I figured they would be."

"Some think you were too harsh. Others think you said what needed saying." She paused. "Mostly people are just uncomfortable because it was direct and they're not used to you being direct."

"What do you think?"

Calantha turned to look at him. "I think you're asking the wrong person. What do you think?"

The question landed with unexpected weight. Sefiathan sat with it for a moment, feeling the shape of the answer before he spoke it. "I think I said what I needed to say. I think Tavis didn't want to hear it. I think whether I was too harsh or not depends entirely on what you value more—being kind or being honest. And I think I'm tired of treating those as the same thing when they're not."

"Good." Calantha nodded once. "That's the only opinion that matters. Whether I agree or Korrin agrees or anyone else agrees—that's just noise. You know what you needed to say. Own that."

Sefiathan felt something settle deeper. This was the lesson, wasn't it? Not that he needed to become callous or stop caring what others thought. But that he needed to stop seeking their validation as proof that he'd done it right. Stop shape-shifting to meet their expectations. Stop treating their shifting opinions as more authoritative than his own direct experience.

"I've spent my whole life doing that," he said quietly. "Checking with everyone else to make sure I was allowed to feel what I feel. Think what I think. Need what I need. Like my internal experience required external confirmation before it was valid."

"Most people do that to some degree." Calantha picked at the frozen ground with one finger. "But you've taken it further than most. You've treated other people's perceptions as more real than your own. As if their version of you was the true one and yours was just wishful thinking."

That hit hard. Sefiathan thought about his father seeing him as disappointing, his mother seeing him as complicated, Mira fitting perfectly into the space he'd failed to fill. He'd treated those external perceptions as objective truth. Had tried to change himself to match what they saw instead of trusting his own sense of who he was.

"I don't know how to not do that," he admitted. "The checking. The seeking validation. It's automatic. Something happens and my first instinct is to look around and see if I did it right, said it right, was right."

"Then start smaller." Calantha's voice was pragmatic. "Stop looking for validation about what you need. You already know what you need. You notice it all the time—the discomfort, the exhaustion, the moments when someone's crossing a line. You just immediately dismiss it if no one else confirms it. So stop dismissing it. Trust that your own perception is valid without waiting for external verification."

Sefiathan thought about that. About how quickly he dismissed compliments but held onto criticism. How he'd dismiss his own discomfort with Tavis's helplessness until someone else pointed it out. How he'd needed Korrin to validate his anger before he felt allowed to express it.

"Start there," Calantha said again. "You already know what you need. Start there. Stop asking permission to need it."

They sat in silence for a while. The wind picked up, cold and biting, but Sefiathan didn't move. He was thinking about the pattern. The constant checking. The way he'd dismissed his own knowing until someone else confirmed it. The way he'd treated his internal compass as suspect, unreliable, requiring verification from people who didn't actually know him better than he knew himself.

He thought about yesterday's confrontation. How certain he'd felt in the moment. How right the words had been even though they were harsh. And then immediately after, the doubt creeping in. Had he been too cruel? Too uncompromising? Should he apologize?

But he'd known in his body that enabling Tavis's helplessness was exhausting. Had known it for days. Had felt the drain of constantly fixing problems that Tavis was perfectly capable of handling himself. That knowing hadn't required anyone else's confirmation. It was just true. Direct experience that didn't need external validation to be valid.

"I already know what I need," Sefiathan said slowly, testing the words. "I need to stop enabling helplessness. I need boundaries that don't require explaining or defending. I need to say hard things without immediately softening them. I need to trust my own perception without checking whether everyone else agrees."

"There you go." Calantha stood, brushing ice crystals from her cloak. "Now stop asking me if you're right about that. You already know."

She walked away, leaving Sefiathan alone with the birch trees and the cold and the slowly solidifying sense that he didn't need anyone else to tell him he was allowed to know what he knew.

He already knew what he needed.

It was time to start there.
