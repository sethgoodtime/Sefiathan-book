Day 7: The Maze of Your Own Making

Sefiathan woke to discover he was lost.

Not in the dramatic way, where you panic and realize you have no idea which direction is which. More in the quiet, creeping way where you look around at trees that all look the same and realize you can't quite remember which way the path was. Or if there even was a path anymore.

He'd camped near the massive tree, that much he knew. But in the pre-dawn darkness, everything looked different. The roots that had seemed like protective shelter last night now looked like grasping fingers. The spaces between trees that had been comforting pockets of shadow were now simply—dark. Unclear. Offering no obvious direction.

Sefiathan stood, folding his blanket with hands that wanted to shake but that he kept deliberately steady. It was fine. He'd find his way. The sun would rise soon, and then he'd be able to orient himself. North was toward the denser forest, he remembered that much. He'd just keep walking and eventually he'd find—something. A stream. Another traveler. A sign.

The sun rose, filtering through the canopy in those same golden shafts that had seemed so beautiful yesterday. Today they just illuminated how utterly identical everything looked. Trees. Moss. Ferns. More trees. Roots. Shadows. Trees.

Sefiathan picked a direction that felt right and started walking.

An hour later, he found himself back at the same massive tree where he'd slept.

He knew it was the same tree because he'd left a small pile of pinecones near the roots when he'd packed up his blanket. There they were, exactly where he'd left them, mocking him with their existence.

"No," Sefiathan said aloud to the forest. "That's not—I walked in a straight line. I didn't turn around."

The forest offered no comment.

He tried again, this time being more deliberate. He picked a tree in the distance and walked directly toward it, then picked another tree beyond that one, creating a line. No doubling back. No curved paths. Straight.

Two hours later, he was standing in front of the massive tree again.

The pinecones were still there.

This time Sefiathan did feel panic flutter in his chest. This wasn't natural. Forests didn't work like this. You couldn't walk in a straight line and end up where you started unless—

Unless the forest wanted you to.

Magic. This was magic. The Wildlands were doing something to him, turning him around, leading him in circles. Trapping him.

"I don't understand," Sefiathan said to the trees, to the forest, to whatever ancient consciousness might be listening. "What do you want? What am I supposed to do?"

A breeze moved through the canopy, making the leaves whisper, but it offered no answers.

Sefiathan sat down heavily on the pile of roots, his back against the massive trunk. His waterskin was still half full. He had maybe two days of dried meat left. If he was stuck here, if the forest wouldn't let him leave—

*Stop looking for the exit. The way forward is to recognize your own fingerprints on every brick.*

The Co-Star reading came back to him. He'd read it this morning before packing up, the way he'd been reading them each day. At the time it had seemed like the usual cryptic advice. Now it felt pointed. Specific.

The maze wasn't the forest. The maze was him.

Sefiathan pulled out his journal—the water-stained one he'd been carrying since leaving Millhaven but had barely written in. He'd meant to document his journey, but every time he'd tried to start, the words felt false. Like he was writing the story he wanted to have rather than the one he was actually living.

He opened to a blank page and stared at it.

What was the maze? What walls had he built brick by brick, blaming circumstances, adding another barrier each time something went wrong?

He started writing, not worrying about making it sound good or meaningful. Just—truth.

*I tell myself I'm on a journey of betterment but I'm actually just running away. That's one wall.*

*I tell myself I'm searching for my power but really I'm terrified I don't have any. That's another wall.*

*I blame my mother for expecting magic from me, but she never actually said she was disappointed. I assumed it. I built that wall myself.*

*I blame my father for making me feel incompetent at carpentry, but he was patient. He never said I was bad at it. I decided I was. My wall.*

*I blame my sister for being good at everything, but she never made me feel less than. I did that to myself. My wall.*

The words came faster now, each one a brick examined, fingerprints visible.

*I left home because I wanted everyone to think I was brave, but really I was scared of staying and having to watch myself be mediocre forever. My wall.*

*I got drunk before I left because I couldn't face my own fear sober. My wall.*

*I keep waiting for something external to give me purpose—a magic ability, a clear quest, a mentor, a sign—instead of deciding what I want for myself. My wall.*

*I compare myself to everyone—to my sister, to Torval's competence, to Lyrei's wisdom, to Mikken's ease with people—and use those comparisons as proof that I'm not enough. My wall. My wall. My wall.*

Sefiathan's hand was cramping but he kept writing.

*I'm walking in circles because I keep looking for the exit instead of recognizing that I built this prison myself. I'm the dream. I'm the nightmare. I'm the thing that makes the nightmare into a dream or the dream into a nightmare.*

*I'm waiting for permission to be good enough when I'm the only one who can give that permission.*

He stopped writing. Read back over what he'd written. Felt something in his chest crack open—not painfully, but like ice breaking on a river in spring. Necessary. Inevitable. Clearing the way for something to flow.

The forest around him looked exactly the same. The massive tree was still there. The pinecones were still in their pile. But something was different.

Sefiathan stood up and looked around properly. Not searching for an exit. Not trying to figure out which direction would take him away from here. Just—looking. Noticing.

The way the moss grew thicker on the north side of trees. The way certain ferns clustered near water sources. The way the oldest trees had different bark texture than younger ones. The way animal trails created subtle indentations in the forest floor that he'd been too busy panicking to notice.

He'd been so focused on being lost that he hadn't actually paid attention to where he was.

Sefiathan shouldered his pack, tucked the journal away, and picked a direction based on what the forest was actually telling him rather than on his own anxiety about choosing wrong. He followed the moss indicators north, watching for game trails, noting where water had carved channels in the earth.

He walked for an hour, aware with every step that he might end up back at the tree again. That the forest might not release him yet. That maybe he hadn't learned whatever lesson was required.

But when he looked back after an hour of walking, the massive tree was nowhere in sight.

The forest had let him pass.

Sefiathan stopped at a small stream to refill his waterskin and catch his breath. He pulled out Lyrei's piece of glass and held it up, watching light refract through it. The rainbows danced across his hands, his face, the water of the stream.

He'd been both the maze and the map. The prison and the key. The dream and the nightmare and the thing that transformed one into the other.

And maybe that was the point. Maybe the journey wasn't about finding some external power or purpose. Maybe it was about recognizing that he'd always been the one building the walls, which meant he was also the one who could stop building them.

Sefiathan drank from the stream, washed his face, and continued north into the Wildlands. He didn't know what he'd find there. Didn't know if he'd discover some great purpose or talent or power. But for the first time, that unknown felt less like a threat and more like—possibility.

His melody came back as he walked, and today it had a new phrase in it. Still incomplete, still searching, but with the beginning of something that might eventually resolve into an ending.

Or maybe not. Maybe some songs stayed incomplete forever, and that was okay too.

The Wildlands stretched ahead, ancient and patient and full of lessons written in the space between trees. Sefiathan walked into them with his fingerprints still visible on the bricks of his old maze, but his hands now free to build something different.

Something that wasn't a prison.

Something that might, eventually, look like a home.
