**Day 50 — February 19, 2026**

Sefiathan spent the morning doing absolutely nothing productive and feeling anxious about it the entire time.

He'd woken with the vague intention of seeking out Orvenna, of sitting with the deep winds and continuing whatever learning was supposed to be happening. But when he actually tried to form the plan into action—get dressed, walk to the usual spot, sit down, listen—his body just refused. Not in the exhausted way of two days ago. More like his limbs had collectively decided that following through on intentions was optional today.

So instead he sat near his tent, watching the gathering wake up around him, feeling the familiar gnaw of anxiety that came with not doing what he was supposed to be doing.

The thing about anxiety, he'd discovered over the years, was that it didn't actually care about reality. It cared about the gap between what you thought you should be doing and what you were actually doing. The wider the gap, the louder the anxiety. And right now, sitting idle while everyone else seemed purposeful, the gap was enormous.

He could see Calantha across the way, organizing something near her fire. Could see Tavis talking animatedly with a small group, gesturing with his whole body. Could see dozens of people engaged in the ordinary business of their days—tending fires, preparing food, maintaining gear, practicing whatever craft or skill had brought them to the Frostmere in the first place.

And here he was. Sitting. Doing nothing. Being useless.

His mind immediately started constructing a plan to fix it. He could go study with Orvenna—that was the obvious solution. Or he could seek out Korrin, continue yesterday's conversation about filtering and honesty. Or he could make himself useful around the gathering, offer to help someone with something, contribute instead of just taking up space.

Each option felt equally impossible. Not because they were difficult, but because choosing any of them meant admitting the anxiety was right—that he needed to be doing something productive to justify his existence. That sitting here idle was actually the problem it felt like.

But what if it wasn't?

What if the anxiety was just anxiety, and sitting here doing nothing was actually fine?

His mind rejected that immediately. Of course it wasn't fine. People didn't come to the Frostmere to sit idly. They came to learn, to grow, to study wind-reading or whatever other skill brought them north. They came with purpose. And he was wasting his time, wasting this opportunity, wasting—

He stopped himself. Recognized the loop. The same spiral he'd been cycling through for the past hour, getting nowhere except more anxious.

Stop researching. Stop making pro-and-con lists.

He hadn't been literally researching, but he'd been doing the mental equivalent—cataloging all the reasons sitting idle was wrong, all the things he should be doing instead, all the ways this morning was a failure. Analyzing the problem from every angle instead of just acting.

But acting on what? The anxiety was telling him to move, to do something, to fix the feeling by being productive. But was that his actual instinct, or just the anxiety wearing an instinct costume?

Your first instinct was right.

He tried to remember what his first instinct had been this morning. Before the anxiety kicked in, before the spiral started. What had he actually wanted to do?

Nothing. He'd wanted to do nothing. To sit quietly without agenda, without purpose, without the constant pressure to be learning or growing or improving. Just to exist for a morning without it meaning anything.

That had been the instinct. Simple and clear. And then immediately the anxiety had shown up with its pro-and-con lists and its very reasonable arguments about why doing nothing was actually avoidance and laziness and all the other words his father would have used.

Act on it before you talk yourself out of it again.

Sefiathan took a breath. Made a decision that felt both small and enormous: he was going to sit here doing nothing for as long as he wanted, and he was going to stop analyzing whether that was okay.

The anxiety immediately protested. Loudly. Compiled a comprehensive list of everything wrong with this plan. Reminded him of all the times doing nothing had been the problem. Pointed out that Orvenna was probably expecting him, that Korrin would think he was avoiding yesterday's conversation, that Calantha would notice his absence and draw conclusions.

He let the anxiety talk. Didn't argue with it. Didn't try to logic his way out of it. Just let it be noise while he continued sitting.

The morning progressed around him. Someone started playing a reed flute somewhere, soft and meandering. The sound wove through the gathering, not quite melody, more like a conversation with itself. Sefiathan found himself following its thread, losing the thread, finding it again.

His hands wanted something to do. He pulled out the small carving knife he'd been carrying since Millhaven—barely used, mostly just weight in his pack. Found a piece of wood someone had left near the fire pit. Started carving without plan, just letting his hands move.

The anxiety was still there, humming its background chorus of should-be-doing-something-else. But quieter now. Easier to ignore.

He carved for a while. Let the wood tell him what it wanted to become instead of imposing a design. The shape that emerged was strange—not quite bird, not quite fish, something in between. Something that didn't fit comfortable categories.

Like him. Too strange for normal, too normal for strange. Existing in the gap between definitions.

The thought made him smile, which made the anxiety spike again—if he was smiling and relaxed then clearly this wasn't the crisis it had been insisting it was, which meant he should definitely get up and do something productive now that he'd had his little break.

He kept carving.

Calantha walked by at some point, glanced at him, kept walking. Didn't ask what he was doing or why he wasn't studying with Orvenna. Just let him be. The simple absence of question felt like permission.

By midday the strange creature was mostly formed—smooth where it wanted to be smooth, rough where it wanted texture. He held it up, studied it from different angles. It wasn't beautiful exactly. More like interesting. Worth looking at. Worth making.

The anxiety had quieted to a whisper. Still there, still insisting this morning had been wasted, but without the urgent edge. More like a habit than a crisis.

He stood up, stretched, felt his body settle back into itself. The morning hadn't been productive in any measurable way. He hadn't learned anything concrete. Hadn't advanced any skills or deepened any understanding. Hadn't even had a profound realization about anxiety or instinct or trust.

He'd just sat. Carved. Existed.

And somehow that felt more honest than any of the elaborate plans his anxiety had been constructing.

He walked to where Orvenna usually sat, found her there as expected. Sat down beside her without speaking. She didn't acknowledge him at first, just kept her attention on the distant frozen expanse.

After a long silence she said, "You spent the morning ignoring me."

"I spent the morning doing nothing."

"Same thing." But there was amusement in her voice. "You were supposed to be here. Sitting with the wind. Instead you were avoiding it."

"I was following my instinct."

"Your instinct to avoid difficult things?"

"My instinct to stop researching whether following my instinct was the right choice." He pulled out the carved creature, showed it to her. "I made this instead."

Orvenna took it, turned it over in her weathered hands. "Strange thing."

"Yeah."

"Suits you." She handed it back. "Tomorrow you'll sit with the wind. Today you carved something strange. Both are allowed."

"The anxiety says only one is allowed."

"The anxiety is a strange beast too." Orvenna settled back into her watching position. "It wants you safe. Safe means productive, measurable, purposeful. Safe means never just existing without justification. But safe isn't always wise."

"How do you know the difference?"

"You don't. You just act. Sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong. Either way, you learn something." She glanced at him. "Now stop talking. You already spent the morning following your instinct. Don't ruin it by needing me to validate the choice."

Sefiathan closed his mouth. Sat with the wind. Let the anxiety hum its background chorus while he ignored it.

His first instinct had been right. He'd acted on it before talking himself out of it.

And here he was. Still existing. Still learning.

Still strange in all the ways that mattered.
