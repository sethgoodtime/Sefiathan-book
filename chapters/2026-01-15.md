Day 15: The Clearing

The ankle happened in the early afternoon.

Sefiathan had been walking for hours through the Deepwood, following game trails that wound between the massive trunks. The forest floor was deceptive—thick moss covered everything, making it impossible to see what lay underneath. Roots, rocks, holes, all hidden beneath that soft green carpet.

His foot found a gap between two roots. His ankle twisted. And suddenly he was on the ground, pack pulling him sideways, a sharp pain shooting up his leg.

"Fuck," Sefiathan said to the indifferent trees.

He sat there for a moment, breathing through the pain, assessing. Not broken—he could tell that much. But definitely sprained. Already swelling. The ankle that wasn't his knee, deciding to join the rebellion.

Sefiathan carefully removed his boot, wincing as the movement jarred the injury. The ankle was already puffy, starting to discolor. He knew what this meant: he wasn't walking anywhere for a while.

The practical part of his brain immediately started cataloging problems. He was deep in the Deepwood, at least a day from the Crossroads Post, probably two days from anything resembling civilization. His supplies would last maybe four or five days if he was careful. He had no idea how long an ankle needed to heal.

The old voice tried to make it worse: *This is what you get for being reckless. For not paying attention. For thinking you could just wander into the wilderness without consequences. Now you're injured and alone and—*

"Stop," Sefiathan said aloud. "I twisted my ankle. That's what happened. Everything else is just noise."

He pulled out his waterskin and the guidebook Maren had sold him. Flipped to the section on injuries. Found the entry on sprains: *Keep weight off it. Elevate if possible. Cold water to reduce swelling. Rest. Most sprains heal in two to four weeks with proper care.*

Two to four weeks.

Sefiathan sat with that information, feeling it settle into his understanding. He'd be here—wherever here was—for weeks. Not days. Weeks.

His first instinct was panic, was making plans to somehow get back to the Crossroads Post, was thinking about what he should do to fix this as quickly as possible. But then he stopped and actually looked around.

He was in a small clearing, maybe thirty feet across. A stream ran along one edge—he could hear it even if he couldn't see it through the ferns. The moss was thick and soft. Ancient trees surrounded the space, their branches creating a natural shelter overhead. And most importantly: he was here now, and there was nowhere else he could be.

So he might as well make it work.

Sefiathan spent the next hour setting up camp properly. Not the quick, minimal setup he'd been doing—this was going to be home for a while, so it needed to actually function as one.

He cleared a space for his fire pit, using rocks from the stream to create a proper ring. Built a lean-to against one of the massive trees using fallen branches, making it sturdy enough to withstand weather. Created a raised bed from moss and ferns, getting his sleeping area off the cold ground. Set up his supplies in an organized way, everything accessible without needing to walk.

His ankle throbbed the entire time, but he worked around it, using a walking stick he'd fashioned from a fallen branch to keep weight off the injury.

When the camp was set up—actually set up, not just functional—Sefiathan sat down with his back against the tree and soaked his ankle in the cold stream water. The shock of cold was intense, but he could feel the swelling start to reduce.

Then he just—stopped. Stopped trying to figure out what to do next. Stopped making plans. Stopped thinking about timelines and progress and getting better.

He was here. His ankle needed time to heal. Time couldn't be rushed or negotiated with or worked around.

So he'd take the time.

That evening, Sefiathan made a proper meal—not because he had to, but because he had time now. He foraged near the clearing, finding edible plants he recognized from the guidebook. Cooked them with the dried fish, seasoned it with some wild garlic he'd found growing near the stream. Made tea from leaves that smelled sharp and clean.

It was the best meal he'd made since leaving Millhaven. Maybe the best meal he'd ever made, period.

After eating, he pulled out the half-carved bird from his pack and kept working on it. His hands knew what to do now, the knife moving in smooth strokes that removed thin curls of wood. The bird was definitely ugly—wings too large, body too small, head at a weird angle. But it was becoming something.

As darkness fell and the fire burned low, Sefiathan realized something: he wasn't angry about the ankle. Wasn't frustrated or resentful or impatient. He was just—here. Dealing with what needed dealing with. Taking the time required because that's what the situation called for.

The wound needed months, not weeks. And that was fine.

He fell asleep that night to the sound of the stream, his ankle elevated on his pack, his body tired but not defeated. Healing wasn't something you rushed. It was something you allowed.

Over the next few days, Sefiathan settled into the rhythm of the clearing. Morning: tend the fire, make breakfast, soak his ankle in cold water. Midday: forage for food, improve the camp, work on small projects. Evening: cook dinner, carve wood, let the fire burn down while he watched stars appear through breaks in the canopy.

He wasn't going anywhere, so he stopped thinking about going anywhere. He was here. This was now. The ankle would heal when it healed.

On the third day in the clearing, Sefiathan realized he was laughing. Actually laughing, at nothing in particular. Just at the absurdity of it—coming into the wilderness to find his purpose and instead spraining his ankle and spending weeks camped in one spot. It was ridiculous. It was perfect.

He pulled out his journal and wrote, just for himself:

*Twisted my ankle. Stuck in a clearing for weeks. My body is teaching me that some things can't be rushed. Healing takes the time it takes. I don't owe anyone a timeline for getting better.*

*I'm not apologizing for being here. Not to the forest, not to myself, not to some imaginary schedule. I'm hurt and I'm healing and that's enough of a reason to exist.*

The carved bird was almost finished now. Still ugly, still lopsided, but undeniably a bird. Wings spread like it was mid-flight, or mid-song, or both. He set it on a flat rock near his fire and looked at it.

"You're ridiculous," he told the bird. "But you're also kind of perfect."

The bird, being wood, didn't respond. But Sefiathan felt like it understood anyway.

He was taking the time he needed to heal. He was occupying space without apologizing for it. He was learning that wounds—physical or otherwise—healed on their own schedule, and rushing them only made things worse.

The Deepwood held him while he mended. The clearing became home. And Sefiathan learned to be patient with himself in ways he'd never managed before.

Some wounds needed months, not weeks. And that was okay.

He had time.
