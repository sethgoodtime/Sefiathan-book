Day 37 — February 6, 2026

The sharing circle met in a natural bowl of land near the Frostmere's eastern edge, where the frozen marsh gave way to a stand of silver birches so pale they looked like bones. Someone had laid out cushions and furs in a rough ring, and a brazier smoked at the center, filling the air with the sweet resinous scent of juniper.

Sefiathan almost didn't go. He stood at the edge of the bowl for several minutes, watching people settle in — maybe thirty of them, a mix he hadn't expected. Not just wind-readers in their layered silks but traders, a pair of dwarven smiths, a woman with owl feathers braided into her hair, a boy who couldn't have been older than fifteen. Calantha was there, cross-legged, not saving him a seat. He appreciated that.

He went because he wanted to. He checked twice to make sure that was true, and it was.

The circle had no leader, exactly, but a woman named Vessha set the rhythm — a wind-reader with a voice like cold water over rock, who explained the only rule: you speak what's true for you today, and no one fixes it. No advice. No lessons. No making someone else's truth into a parable for your own.

The first few speakers talked about journeys, lost siblings, a business that failed, a child who'd grown strange and distant. Sefiathan listened with his whole body, the way he always did — leaning in, tracking every micro-expression — and caught himself doing it. Caught the familiar pull to absorb their pain, to carry it, to somehow metabolize it into something useful for them.

He made himself lean back. Just listen. Not carry.

A man across the circle — broad-shouldered, wind-burned, with hands like shovels — spoke about his wife. Not a dramatic story. She hadn't left or died or betrayed him. She was home, she was fine, she loved him. But he'd realized, slowly, over years, that he'd turned his heart into a museum of their early days together. Every new thing she became, every way she changed, he measured against the woman he'd fallen in love with at nineteen. And he'd been loving a ghost while the real woman made dinner beside him every night.

"I keep the exhibits polished," the man said, attempting a smile. "She keeps asking me to look at her, and I keep showing her the portrait I painted twenty years ago."

Something about the way he said it — the bewildered tenderness, the shame that wasn't quite shame — cracked Sefiathan open in a place he hadn't expected. Not about a wife. About Millhaven. About his mother, his father, Elara. He'd left home carrying preserved versions of all of them — his father's dismissiveness frozen at its worst, his mother's sadness pressed flat like a flower in a book. He'd been so busy curating the museum of his grievances that he'd stopped wondering who they might be becoming without him there.

Had his mother planted new things this winter? Had his father built something he was proud of? Had Elara laughed at something stupid with a friend?

He didn't know. He hadn't left room to wonder, because wondering meant admitting they were real and changing and alive, and not just exhibits in the story of why he'd had to leave.

When his turn came — and it did come, the circle patient and unhurried — he said only: "I think I've been in love with my own sadness. And I'm trying to figure out if I'm ready to meet what comes after it."

No one fixed it. The circle moved on.

Afterward, walking back through the birches, he noticed the trees closest to where the circle had sat were budding. Small green nubs along the white branches, impossibly early, impossibly tender. Probably just a warm patch of ground near the brazier. He didn't think about it further.

But the buds opened by evening into tiny, pale leaves that shivered in the wind like something just born and startled to be alive.
