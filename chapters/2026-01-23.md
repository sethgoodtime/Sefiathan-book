Day 23: Someone Is Thinking of You

Sefiathan was gathering firewood at the edge of the meadow when he found the second marker.

Not like the memorial post from days ago—this was smaller, cruder. Just three stones stacked carefully, with a strip of cloth tied around the top stone. The cloth was weathered but still recognizable: blue and white stripes, the kind of pattern you'd see on a scarf or headband.

He crouched next to the cairn, studying it. Someone had been here. Had built this deliberately, marking something. A memory? A message? A simple "I was here"?

Sefiathan touched the cloth lightly, and something caught in his chest. A feeling he couldn't quite name, except to say it felt like being thought of.

Someone, somewhere, had stopped at this spot. Had taken the time to stack three stones. Had tied their cloth around it—something personal, something that meant enough to leave behind. And maybe, in doing that, they'd thought about whoever might find it next.

They'd thought about him, even without knowing he existed.

The realization settled strange and warm: he was being carried in someone's thoughts right now, somewhere in Parogar. Maybe Torval, wondering if the kid he'd paid camping fees for had made it through the Wildlands. Maybe Lyrei, her silver-flecked eyes catching light as she turned her orb and saw possible futures where their paths crossed again. Maybe Maren at the Crossroads Post, noting that the ridge walker hadn't come back through yet.

Maybe even Thessaly, a day's walk north, remembering the oddball at the Singing Stones who loved sideways.

People carried each other. Even in absence, even in silence. The thought of someone could be a form of presence.

Sefiathan walked back to his camp with that feeling still warm in his chest. He tended his fire, prepared his midday meal, went through the familiar routines. But underneath it all, he was thinking about being thought of. About the invisible threads that connected people across distance.

His mother probably thought of him every morning when she tended her garden. His father when he opened his workshop. Elara when she balanced the accounts and found the coins he'd left behind to help while he was gone.

They carried him in their thoughts with conviction, even though he wasn't there. Even though he'd left angry, left without fully resolving things, left them to wonder if he was alright.

That afternoon, a bird landed near his camp. Not the ugly bird—a different one, sleek and ordinary, just passing through. But it stayed longer than it needed to, hopping around the edges of the stone circle, calling out occasionally in a way that felt almost conversational.

Sefiathan watched it, and found himself speaking aloud: "Someone's thinking of you right now. Wondering where you are. Hoping you're safe."

The bird cocked its head, as if considering this information, then flew away.

But the words stayed with Sefiathan, settling deeper. Someone was thinking of him. Multiple someones, probably. Carrying him in their thoughts with conviction, the way he was learning to carry them.

When people finally spoke up—when Elara sent a letter, or when he eventually made his way home—he needed to resist the reflex to minimize it. To assume they were just being polite. To dismiss their concern as obligation rather than care.

They were thinking of him. That was real. That mattered.

As evening approached, Sefiathan did something he hadn't done since leaving Millhaven: he sat down with blank space in his mind and let himself think of people deliberately. Not processing or planning or working through emotions. Just—thinking of them.

His mother, hands in soil, speaking to plants the way some people spoke to children.

His father, squinting at a joint he'd cut perfectly after twenty patient attempts.

Elara, rolling her eyes at his dramatics but keeping his room exactly as he'd left it.

Darius in Greymark, probably still arguing about nothing with whoever would listen.

Mira, creating beautiful things with wood, no longer haunted by comparison to someone who'd never been her competition.

Torval, Mikken, and Lyrei, wherever their search had taken them.

Maren, serving ale to ridge walkers and valley people alike.

The silent woman, making soup for strangers in the deep forest.

Thessaly, following her strange path north.

He thought of them all deliberately, with conviction. Carried them in his thoughts the way they might be carrying him. Let the thinking be a form of connection, even across distance, even without words.

The stones sang around him as darkness fell, and Sefiathan hummed his melody—the one that was complete now, the one with words. But tonight he hummed it thinking of specific people. Sending it out like a message: *I'm here. I'm alright. I'm thinking of you too.*

Maybe it would reach them somehow. Maybe not. But the sending mattered anyway.

That night, Sefiathan lay in his sleeping space looking at stars through gaps in the stone circle, and felt less alone than he had in weeks. Not because anyone was physically present, but because he could feel the invisible network of people who carried each other in their thoughts.

Someone was thinking of him right now. He was certain of it.

And he was thinking of them back.

The conviction of it—the both/and of being apart and being connected—felt like another piece of his strange magic. The oddball way of loving at a distance, loving through absence, loving by holding people carefully in thought even when you couldn't hold them in person.

His melody drifted up toward the stars, carrying names and faces and the warm certainty that somewhere, someone was humming their own melody and thinking of him.

The stones sang harmony. The wind carried it all away and everywhere.

And Sefiathan, the oddball who loved sideways, learned that being thought of was its own kind of presence.

That being held in someone's careful attention was its own kind of home.
