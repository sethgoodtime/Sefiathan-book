Day 32 - February 1, 2026
They woke to find the weather had shifted overnight. Heavy clouds pressed low over the mountains, and the air carried the metallic smell of coming snow. Korrin assessed the sky with the practiced eye of someone who'd spent years reading weather.
"We should make good distance today," they said, packing up camp with efficient speed. "Storm's coming, maybe by evening. Want to get as far as we can before it hits."
Sefiathan nodded, moving quickly through his own morning routine. They ate cold food to save time, drank water, and were walking within twenty minutes of waking. The path continued climbing, winding between increasingly barren rocks.
They'd been walking perhaps two hours when Korrin stopped abruptly.
"What's wrong?" Sefiathan asked.
Korrin stood very still, head tilted like they were listening to something distant. "My cousin."
"What about them?"
"Something's—" Korrin's expression shifted, became urgent in a way Sefiathan hadn't seen before. "Something's wrong. I can feel it."
"Feel it how?"
"Herd sense. We're—connected, family members. Especially close ones. I can feel when something's very wrong." Korrin was already turning, scanning the landscape ahead. "They're in trouble. Real trouble."
Sefiathan felt his careful plans for the day dissolve. They were supposed to walk, make distance, reach a specific campsite Korrin had mentioned. Steady progress toward the Frostmere gathering. But Korrin was already moving—not forward along the path, but northwest, toward rougher terrain.
"Wait—where are you going?"
"That direction. They're that direction. Maybe half a day's travel, maybe more." Korrin looked back at him, and their face was drawn tight with worry. "I have to go now. The feeling—it's not getting better. It's getting worse."
"But the storm—"
"I know." Korrin adjusted their pack, already committed to this new direction. "You should stay on the path. There's a shepherd's shelter about four hours ahead. You can wait out the storm there, and I'll—I'll find you after. Once I know they're safe."
Sefiathan looked at the path ahead—clear, mapped, leading to a known destination. Then at the rough terrain Korrin was about to cross—unmarked, dangerous, with a storm coming. Everything in him screamed that this was foolish, that Korrin should wait, that whatever was wrong could wait until after the weather cleared.
But Korrin's face held something he recognized. The terror of someone close being in crisis. The complete impossibility of waiting when action was possible.
"I'm coming with you," Sefiathan said.
"You don't have to—"
"I know. I'm coming anyway."
Korrin held his gaze for a moment, then nodded. "Stay close. This terrain is unstable, and we're moving fast."
They left the path.
The going was immediately harder—loose scree that shifted under their feet, no clear route, just Korrin's instinctive sense of direction pulling them forward. Sefiathan focused on keeping up, on not slowing them down. His carefully packed schedule, his planned rest stops, his measured approach to the day—all of it abandoned for this urgent scramble across dangerous ground.
The sky darkened as they climbed. The first snow began falling around midday—light flurries at first, then heavier. Korrin moved with single-minded focus, pausing occasionally to recalibrate their direction, then pushing forward again.
"How much further?" Sefiathan called over the rising wind.
"I don't know. The sense isn't that precise. Just—that direction, and that it's urgent."
They crossed a ridge and descended into a narrow valley. The wind cut through here, sharp and bitter. Sefiathan's hands were numb despite his gloves. His face stung with cold. But Korrin kept moving, and he kept following.
Around what might have been early afternoon—hard to tell with the clouds so heavy—they found signs of a struggle. Torn fabric caught on rocks. Disturbed earth. And blood, small drops of it leading further down the valley.
Korrin made a sound—half-cry, half-growl—and broke into a run. Sefiathan followed, his heart hammering. They rounded a bend and found a centaur collapsed against a boulder, wrapped in a torn cloak, shivering violently.
"Tavis!" Korrin was beside them instantly, hands checking for injuries. "What happened? Where are you hurt?"
The centaur—Tavis, Korrin's cousin—tried to speak but their teeth chattered too hard. They were soaked through, probably from falling into water somewhere. In this cold, that was deadly.
"We need shelter," Sefiathan said, looking around desperately. "Now. Or they'll—"
"There." Korrin pointed to what looked like an overhang in the rock face. "Help me get them there."
Together they half-carried, half-dragged Tavis to the overhang. It cut back deeper than Sefiathan had expected—almost a cave, protected from the wind and snow. Korrin worked with frantic efficiency, stripping Tavis of their wet clothes, wrapping them in every dry blanket they had between the three of them.
"Fire," Korrin said. "We need fire. Now."
Sefiathan had never built a fire so fast. His hands shook—from cold, from urgency, from fear—but he got it lit. Fed it carefully until it caught properly, then built it up. The smoke filled the small space but the warmth was worth it.
Korrin held Tavis close, sharing body heat, murmuring in a language Sefiathan didn't understand. Centaur words, soft and urgent. Tavis was still shivering, but less violently now. Their eyes were closed, their breathing shallow but steady.
Sefiathan melted snow in his small pot, made warm water. Added some of the herbs Korrin had bought in the village, creating something that was barely tea but was warm and that was what mattered. He held the cup to Tavis's lips, helped them drink small sips.
Hours passed. The storm outside built to a roar—wind shrieking, snow falling so thick that the cave entrance was barely visible. But inside, the fire burned. Tavis slowly stopped shivering. Their breathing deepened, evened out. They slept, finally, wrapped in blankets with Korrin keeping watch.
Only then did Sefiathan let himself collapse against the cave wall. His body ached from the scramble across rough terrain. His fingers were still half-numb. His carefully laid plans for the day were completely destroyed—they weren't at the shepherd's shelter, weren't making steady progress, weren't following the mapped route.
They were in a cave in a storm with an injured centaur, and he'd never been more certain he was exactly where he needed to be.
"Thank you," Korrin said quietly. "For coming. For not making me choose between getting you to safety and getting to Tavis."
"There was no choice," Sefiathan replied. "Someone needed help. We helped."
Korrin looked at him, something shifting in their expression. "Most people would have stayed on the path. Would have said it was too dangerous, too uncertain, too foolish to chase a feeling across unmarked terrain in a coming storm."
"Maybe. But that's not—" Sefiathan paused, trying to articulate something he'd just learned about himself. "I spent so much time trying to plan everything. Schedule everything. Make sure I was always making the right strategic choice. But the crises don't care about strategy. They just—happen. And you can either drop everything and show up, or you can stick to your plan and miss what actually matters."
The fire crackled. Outside, the storm continued its assault. Tavis slept on, their color slowly returning.
"What happened to them?" Sefiathan asked.
"Don't know yet. They'll tell us when they wake up." Korrin adjusted the blanket around Tavis. "But they were alone out here. In trouble. If we'd stayed on the path, if we'd waited until after the storm—"
They didn't finish the sentence. Didn't need to.
Sefiathan fed the fire, keeping it steady. His plans were ruined. His schedule was meaningless. His carefully mapped route to the Frostmere was abandoned somewhere back on that path they'd left hours ago.
And he felt more present, more purposeful, more genuinely useful than he had in weeks.
This was what mattered. Not the plan, but the showing up. Not the schedule, but the crisis. Not the template for how things should go, but the messy reality of what actually happened.
The storm raged outside. Inside, three people huddled around a fire in a cave, alive because someone had dropped their agenda and run toward trouble instead of away from it.
Sefiathan's melody hummed in his chest, and tonight it had a quality of fierce presence. Not gentle, not contemplative, but immediate and vital and real.
The crisis was teaching him more than any strategy session ever could.
And the lesson was simple: show up. Drop the agenda. Let your carefully laid plans get disrupted by the urgent needs of people you care about.
That was where life actually happened.
Not in the planning, but in the showing up.
Not in the template, but in the crisis.
Not in the schedule, but in the sacred disruption of someone needing you now.Feb 4
