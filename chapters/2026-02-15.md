**Day 46 — February 15, 2026**

Sefiathan woke with a headache that felt like his skull was slowly being compressed. Not the sharp sudden pain of injury—something duller, more persistent. The kind of ache that suggested his body had been trying to tell him something for days and he'd been too busy analyzing wind patterns to listen.

He lay in his bedroll longer than usual, staring at the canvas ceiling of his tent. The light filtering through was the flat grey of overcast morning. Somewhere outside, the gathering was already stirring—voices, footsteps, the sound of fires being stoked. The same activities that happened every morning, the reliable rhythm of a community waking up.

He should get up. Should go to Orvenna's granite slab, continue his studies. Should be productive with the day. Should not waste the opportunity to learn.

He stayed in his bedroll.

His body felt heavy. Not sick, exactly. Just thoroughly tired. The kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix because it's not about sleep. It's about running on fumes and pretending the tank isn't empty. About pushing through warning signs because acknowledging them feels like weakness.

When had he last taken a day to just rest? Not injured-and-forced-to-rest like that week in the clearing. Actually chosen rest. Chosen to do nothing productive, to let his body recover, to not perform learning or growth or self-improvement for even one day.

He couldn't remember.

Even yesterday, watching Korrin teach, he'd been learning. Extracting wisdom. Making it useful. Turning observation into insight into something he could apply to his own self-analysis. Never just watching because watching was pleasant. Never just being idle because idleness was allowed.

The headache pulsed. His body's way of voting.

Sefiathan forced himself to sit up. The movement made his skull throb. He rubbed his face, felt the grit of several days without proper washing, the scratchiness of beard growth. When had he last bathed? The Frostmere had a area designated for that, heated somehow by underground springs. He'd been meaning to go. Kept meaning to go. Never quite made the time because there was always something more important to do.

He crawled out of his tent into grey morning. The sky was low and heavy, promising snow. The air had that peculiar stillness that comes before weather. Around him, the gathering moved through its routines. No one looked at him with expectation. No one was waiting for him to show up and perform.

He walked to where Korrin was grooming his coat—a private morning ritual Sefiathan had learned not to interrupt unless invited. Korrin saw him coming and raised an eyebrow.

"You look terrible," Korrin said.

"I feel terrible."

"Then do something about it."

Sefiathan almost laughed. "That simple?"

"Usually is." Korrin returned to his grooming. "You're not dying. You're just exhausted. Your body's been telling you that for days. You going to listen, or you going to wait until it makes the decision for you?"

"What would you do?"

"Not my body. Not my decision." But Korrin glanced at him, and there was something almost gentle in his expression. "But if you're asking my opinion? I'd stop treating rest like something you have to earn. I'd take the day off. Rest. Let the work wait."

"I'm supposed to study with Orvenna—"

"She'll be there tomorrow." Korrin moved to his other side, brush moving in long steady strokes. "The wind isn't going anywhere. Your education isn't going to collapse because you took one day to be human."

Sefiathan stood there feeling the truth of that war with his ingrained sense that stopping was failing. That rest was laziness. That taking care of himself was somehow selfish, indulgent, weak.

"I don't know how to just rest," he admitted. "I'll just lie there thinking about all the things I should be doing."

"So don't lie there. Go to the hot springs. Wash yourself. Sit in water that feels good. That's not nothing—that's maintenance. That's you acknowledging your body exists and needs care." Korrin paused his grooming. "You spend so much energy trying to be wise. Maybe spend some energy trying to be alive."

The headache pulsed agreement.

Sefiathan found the hot springs after asking directions twice. A natural formation at the edge of the gathering, steam rising where heated water met cold air. A few others were there—an older wind-reader soaking in silence, two younger people talking quietly at the far end. No one paid him attention when he stripped down and eased himself into the water.

The heat was immediate and overwhelming. His muscles, which he hadn't realized were clenched, began to slowly unknot. The headache didn't disappear but it softened, became less aggressive. He sank down until the water reached his chin and just breathed.

Didn't think about wind patterns. Didn't analyze yesterday's conversation with Korrin. Didn't try to extract meaning or construct insight. Just sat in hot water and felt his body begin to relax.

At some point the older wind-reader left. Then the younger people. Sefiathan stayed, adding hot water when it cooled, watching steam rise into grey sky. Snow began to fall—small lazy flakes that dissolved before reaching the water. Beautiful for no reason except that snow was beautiful. No deeper meaning required.

He thought about Orvenna waiting at the granite slab, probably not waiting at all because she didn't seem like someone who waited for students who didn't show up. Thought about all the productive things he could be doing instead of sitting in hot water watching snow fall. Thought about how his father would call this laziness, self-indulgence, weakness.

And then he stopped thinking about it.

His body was tired. His mind was tired. And for once—just for today—that was enough reason to rest. Not because he'd earned it through sufficient suffering. Not because he'd finally broken down enough to justify it. Just because he needed it, and needing things was allowed.

The snow fell. The water stayed warm. His headache gradually faded to something manageable.

He stayed there until his fingers pruned, and even then he stayed a little longer, because leaving felt like admitting he should have been doing something else all along. And he was tired of should.

Finally he climbed out, dressed slowly, walked back to his tent. The gathering continued around him. Work happened without his participation. The world kept turning.

He crawled back into his bedroll in the grey afternoon and slept.
