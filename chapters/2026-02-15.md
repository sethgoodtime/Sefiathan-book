**Day 45 - February 15, 2026**

The gathering had thinned by morning. Sefiathan woke to find half the tents already gone, frost-bright grass showing through where canvas had stood the night before. The wind-readers who remained moved with deliberate slowness, as if the air itself had thickened overnight.

Korrin was awake, sitting cross-legged near the remnants of their fire, staring at nothing in particular. Tavis had wandered off somewhere, probably to find breakfast or avoid the centaur's brooding—it was hard to tell which impulse governed him from moment to moment.

"You look like someone who pushed through a wall that wasn't actually there," Sefiathan said, settling onto a flat stone nearby.

Korrin's laugh was rough. "That specific, huh?"

"I've worn that face." Sefiathan picked up a stick and prodded the cold ashes, not because he wanted to restart the fire but because his hands needed something to do. "Usually right before I collapsed."

"I'm not going to collapse."

"No," Sefiathan agreed. "You're going to sit here pretending you're fine until your body makes the decision for you."

The centaur's jaw tightened. For a long moment, Sefiathan thought he'd overstepped, that Korrin would stand and walk away and they'd spend the rest of the day in careful silence. Instead, Korrin exhaled slowly through his nose.

"We should keep moving," he said. "We've been here three days. That's long enough."

"For what?"

"For rest. Recovery. Whatever we were supposed to get here."

Sefiathan broke the stick in half, then broke it again. "And have you? Gotten whatever you were supposed to get?"

Korrin didn't answer. The silence stretched between them, not hostile but not comfortable either. Somewhere across the gathering grounds, someone was singing—a low, repetitive melody that the wind carried in fragments.

"I kept going for seventeen years," Korrin said finally. "Seventeen years of telling myself I was fine, that I'd deal with it later, that there were more important things than how I felt. And you know what happened?"

"You ended up here."

"I ended up here." Korrin looked at his hands, at the old scars that crossed his palms. "And now I don't know how to stop. Even when I'm not moving, I'm moving. Even when I'm resting, I'm not resting. It's like I forgot how."

Sefiathan understood that more than he wanted to admit. The constant motion, the relentless drive to be somewhere else, to be doing something, to never quite arrive at the moment he was actually in. He'd spent most of his life like that, convinced that if he just kept going, eventually he'd outrun the weight he carried.

"What happens if you just... stop?" he asked.

"I don't know."

"Maybe that's worth finding out."

Korrin looked at him with something between frustration and desperation. "And if I can't? If I've forgotten how to be still?"

"Then you learn again." Sefiathan tossed the broken stick pieces into the dead fire. "Same way you learned anything else. Badly at first, then less badly, then eventually you remember it was something you knew all along."

Calantha appeared from between two tents, carrying a clay pot that steamed in the cold air. She set it down near them without ceremony, then lowered herself to the ground with the careful movements of someone whose joints protested mornings.

"Tea," she said. "And before either of you argues, you both look like you need it."

Korrin opened his mouth, probably to insist he was fine, then closed it again. Sefiathan felt oddly proud of him for that small surrender.

"The wind-readers are leaving," Calantha continued, pouring tea into three wooden cups. "Most of them, anyway. They got what they came for. But Maris asked if you'd stay another day." She looked at Korrin. "She said something about how centaurs are terrible at hearing their own bodies until someone else points out the obvious."

"She said that?"

"She implied it. Loudly." Calantha handed them each a cup. "The Frostmere isn't going anywhere. Neither is wherever you're going after this. But you—" She gestured at Korrin with her own cup. "You look like you're about to fall apart, and I'd rather you did it here where there are people to catch you than out there where there's nothing but snow and stubbornness."

Korrin held the tea but didn't drink it. Sefiathan watched emotions chase each other across the centaur's face—pride, resistance, relief, exhaustion. Finally, Korrin's shoulders dropped.

"One more day," he said quietly.

"Good." Calantha sipped her tea. "Now drink that before it gets cold. And you—" She turned to Sefiathan. "Stop trying to fix him. Sometimes people just need someone to sit with them while they fall apart."

Sefiathan felt the words land somewhere true. He'd been so focused on helping Korrin see what he couldn't see himself that he'd forgotten the simplest thing: sometimes the only help was presence, not solutions.

They sat in silence as the morning brightened around them. The last of the tents came down. The wind carried the smell of snow from the north. And Korrin, finally, stopped pretending to be fine.

When Tavis returned with bread and dried fruit, he found the three of them still sitting there, not talking, just being. He looked between them, shrugged, and sat down too.

One more day, Sefiathan thought. One more day of staying still when every instinct said to move. One more day of trusting that rest was not the same as giving up.

It felt like the hardest work he'd done in weeks.
