Day 13: A Room of Your Own

Sefiathan woke before dawn in the camp spot Maren had recommended—a sheltered hollow between two massive oaks about a quarter mile from the Crossroads Post. His new supplies were stacked neatly beside him: the dried fruit and hardtack, the salted fish, the hunting knife that actually had weight to it, the small guidebook.

He'd traded away almost everything for these provisions. Including Lyrei's piece of glass, which had felt like giving up something important until Maren had said she'd make sure it reached someone who needed it. Passing it forward, like the wooden bird. Like the cleared path.

The settlement would be stirring soon—he could hear the first sounds of activity drifting through the trees. But he stayed in his hollow, watching the sky lighten through the canopy, not quite ready to move yet.

There was something he needed to do first. Something he'd been avoiding.

Sefiathan pulled out his journal—the water-stained one he'd been carrying since Millhaven but had lately been using only to process lessons and catalog growth. He flipped past those recent entries to find blank pages further back.

Then he started writing, but differently than before. Not about what had happened. Not processing or explaining. Just—something for himself alone.

*I like the way morning smells in the forest. Damp earth and green things and that particular quality of air that hasn't been breathed yet.*

He paused, feeling self-conscious even though no one would read this. Then continued.

*I don't like sleeping on the ground as much as I thought I would. My back hurts most mornings. But I like the sounds—the way the forest is never actually quiet, just full of small noises you have to pay attention to hear.*

*I think about my sister more than I expected to. Not missing her exactly, but wondering what she'd say about all this. She'd probably tell me I'm being dramatic. She'd be right.*

*I'm scared most of the time but it's a different kind of scared than I used to be. Less 'what if I fail' and more 'what if I choose wrong.' Which feels like progress but I'm not sure why.*

*I don't know if I'm finding my power or purpose or whatever I left home to find. But I'm learning things. Like how to tell which mushrooms will kill you. And how to start a fire in damp conditions. And that my body will tell me what it needs if I actually listen. And that love is mostly about showing up consistently, which sounds boring but isn't.*

He stopped writing and read back over what he'd written. None of it was profound. None of it would mean anything to anyone else. It was just—his. Small observations and half-formed thoughts that didn't need to be lessons or insights or proof of growth.

Just him, furnishing the secret room inside himself. The one he'd been too busy managing other people's chaos to decorate.

Sefiathan kept writing, not overthinking it, just letting words come:

*Favorite food so far: that soup the silent woman made. Second favorite: those berries I found by the stream even though they made my tongue tingle weird.*

*Least favorite: everything about that day my knee gave out. Though I guess I learned something so maybe it was worth it.*

*Things I miss from home: My mother's garden. The smell of sawdust in my father's workshop. My sister's annoying competence. The way our kitchen felt in the mornings.*

*Things I don't miss: Feeling like a disappointment. Apologizing for existing. Waiting for permission to take up space.*

*Best moment: The ugly bird singing. Worst moment: Walking in circles in the maze. Most confusing moment: The woman making me breakfast without speaking. Most surprising moment: Choosing not to go to the temple.*

He filled three pages with small things—observations about clouds, a particularly interesting beetle he'd seen, the way his new knife felt balanced in his hand, thoughts about whether centaurs got horseshoes or just regular shoes or no shoes.

None of it mattered. All of it was his.

When the sun was fully up and the sounds from the Crossroads Post indicated proper morning activity, Sefiathan closed his journal and packed up his camp. He left the hollow cleaner than he'd found it, covering the spot where his fire had been, scattering the rocks he'd used to make a ring.

At the Crossroads Post, Maren was already serving breakfast to a mixed group of travelers. She nodded to Sefiathan when he entered, gestured to an empty spot at the bar.

"Heading out today?"

"Yeah. North."

"Good. You need anything else before you go?"

Sefiathan thought about it. Then: "Can I just sit here for a bit? Just—be here?"

Maren studied him with those amused eyes. "You don't need permission to exist in a space, ridge walker. But yeah, sit as long as you want. Breakfast is two copper if you've got it."

He didn't have two copper. He'd spent everything on supplies.

"I've got—" Sefiathan pulled out Mikken's handkerchief, the one with the dancing chicken. "This?"

Maren took it, examined the embroidery, laughed. "This is ridiculous. I love it. Yeah, this'll cover breakfast."

She brought him porridge with dried fruit mixed in, and tea that tasted like the moonbright his mother used to make but with something else added—something sharper, more awake. Sefiathan ate slowly, not performing gratitude or making conversation, just—being there. Taking up space without apologizing for it.

Around him, the Crossroads Post hummed with activity. A dwarf and two humans were negotiating over a map spread across one table. The centaur from yesterday was arranging supplies in organized piles. One of the fae sat in a corner writing something in a book with ink that seemed to shimmer.

All these people, all these stories intersecting briefly in this place. And Sefiathan was one of them—not special, not significant, just another traveler eating breakfast at a crossroads.

It felt good. Felt right. Felt like he was part of something larger without needing to justify his presence in it.

When he finished eating, he caught Maren's attention. "Thank you. For the food. For the supplies yesterday. For—" He wasn't sure how to finish.

"For treating you like you belonged here?" Maren supplied.

"Yeah."

"You did belong here. You took the ridge route. That's the price of admission." She refilled his tea without being asked. "Where exactly you heading up north?"

"Don't know. Just—deeper in. See what's there."

"Wildlands get properly wild another day or two north of here. Game trails mostly, old growth, places that haven't seen many people. You'll want to follow the waterways—they'll keep you from getting completely turned around." She pulled out a scrap of paper and sketched a rough map. "This stream here, about a day north. Follow it west and you'll hit what the locals call the Deepwood proper. Ancient trees, thick canopy, real wilderness. That's where you'll find what you're looking for."

"I don't know what I'm looking for."

"Even better. Means you'll recognize it when you find it." She handed him the map. "And Sefiathan? That secret room inside you? The one you've been too busy for? Keep furnishing it. Small things. Things that are just for you. That's how you build a self."

He must have looked surprised that she knew his name—he hadn't introduced himself.

Maren grinned. "You wrote it in the guestbook last night when you bought supplies. I pay attention." She tapped the side of her head. "Part of running a crossroads. You remember the people who pass through, even when they don't think they're memorable."

Sefiathan shouldered his pack—heavier now, properly supplied—and headed for the door. Then stopped and turned back.

"One small thing," he said. "I'm choosing right now. I like morning light. The way it looks coming through trees. That's mine."

"Good," Maren said. "That's a good thing to like."

He walked north from the Crossroads Post as morning turned toward midday, Maren's rough map tucked in his pocket, his journal full of small observations that belonged only to him. The path ahead was uncertain, but he had supplies now. Had direction. Had a self that was slowly becoming furnished with preferences and observations and small moments of "this is mine."

The voice in his head tried to comment—tried to turn this into another lesson, another proof of growth, another performance of enlightenment. But Sefiathan just let it talk. He was busy noticing the way a particular bird called from high branches, and deciding whether he liked that sound or not.

Turned out he did like it. It went in the room. His room. The one he was building inside himself, one small choice at a time.

By afternoon he'd reached the stream Maren had marked on her map. He stopped there to refill his waterskin, to eat some of the dried fruit, to rest his knee which was doing better but still deserved attention.

And sitting by that stream, Sefiathan made another small choice: he liked the sound of moving water. Preferred it to stillness. That was his too.

The room was getting more furnished. Not with profound revelations or important lessons. Just with preferences. With small observations. With the accumulation of "I like this" and "I don't like that" and "I'm not sure yet but I'll figure it out."

It wasn't much. But it was his. And that was enough for Day Thirteen.
