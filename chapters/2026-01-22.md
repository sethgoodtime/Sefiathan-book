Day 22: The Visitor

Sefiathan woke to the sound of footsteps.

Not animal footsteps—those had become familiar over three weeks in the wilderness. Human footsteps. Boots on grass. Someone walking toward the stone circle in the early morning light.

He sat up, suddenly aware of how exposed he was. His camp was in the open, visible from any direction. His fire had burned down to coals but would still be obvious. And he had no weapon except the hunting knife, which was currently somewhere in his pack.

A figure emerged from the morning mist at the edge of the stone circle. Tall, wrapped in a traveling cloak, moving with the easy confidence of someone who belonged here as much as anyone could.

The figure stopped at the edge of the circle, waiting. Not threatening, but not leaving either. Just—present.

"Morning," Sefiathan called, his voice rough from sleep. "I didn't know anyone else came here."

"Most don't." The voice was feminine, melodic in a way that suggested she might not be entirely human. "But some of us pass through on occasion."

She walked into the circle slowly, letting Sefiathan see her clearly. Definitely not human—or not only human. Her features had that fae quality, the otherworldly beauty that made you look twice. Tall and graceful, with silver-threaded hair and eyes that caught the morning light strangely.

"I'm Sefiathan," he said, because that seemed like the thing to do when a possibly-fae stranger appeared in your camp at dawn.

"Thessaly." She settled onto a stone across from him, her cloak spreading around her like water. "You've been here two days."

It wasn't a question.

"Yeah. The stones—they're something."

"They are." Thessaly pulled something from her pack—a small pot, some kind of grain, dried fruit. "Have you eaten?"

The question caught Sefiathan off-guard. Here was a stranger, possibly dangerous, definitely fae or part-fae, and she was offering to make breakfast. It felt like an echo of the silent woman in the Deepwood, that moment of unexpected care from someone who owed him nothing.

"Not yet."

"Then we'll eat."

Thessaly worked with the same quiet efficiency as the woman who'd made him soup. She built up his fire without asking, added water to her pot, began preparing something that smelled of cinnamon and honey. And Sefiathan, remembering his lessons about receiving help, just—let her. Didn't apologize, didn't try to take over, didn't perform gratitude. Just accepted what was offered.

They ate in comfortable silence, the stones singing around them as the morning wind picked up. The food was rich and warming, exactly what a cold dawn required. When they finished, Thessaly cleaned the pot in the morning dew that had collected in hollows of the stones, then settled back to look at him properly.

"You love strangely," she said.

"What?"

"Your love. It's strange. Intense but sideways. You don't love the way most humans do." She said it like an observation, not a judgment. "The way you tend your fire, arrange your camp, notice the stones singing. It's all love, but not the kind that gets recognized as such."

Sefiathan felt something twist in his chest. She'd seen him for maybe thirty minutes and somehow identified the thing he'd been trying to figure out for twenty-seven years.

"I don't know how to love the normal way," he admitted. "I tried. With my family, with friends. But it always came out wrong. Too much or not enough or just—different than what people expected."

"Because you're an oddball," Thessaly said, not unkindly. "The ones who love differently always are. You probably spent your whole life trying to hide it, trying to make your love look like everyone else's love."

"Yeah."

"Waste of time." She pulled out a waterskin, offered it to him. "Your strange magic—your odd way of loving things—that's precisely what makes you unforgettable. The people who understand it will remember you for the rest of their lives. The ones who don't..." She shrugged. "They'll forget anyway."

Sefiathan drank from the waterskin, letting the cold water wake him fully. "How do you know all this?"

"Because I'm an oddball too." Thessaly smiled, and it transformed her face from beautiful to extraordinary. "I fell in love with a river once. Spent three years following it from source to sea. People thought I was mad. But the river knew. The river remembered."

"That's—"

"Strange? Yes. But strange magic is the only magic worth having." She stood, brushing off her cloak. "I'm heading north, toward the Frostmere. You're welcome to walk with me for a day if you'd like. Or stay here. The stones won't mind either way."

"I think I'll stay," Sefiathan said. "For a little while longer."

"Good. The staying is important." Thessaly shouldered her pack, then paused. "Sefiathan. Stop hiding your strangeness. The people who fall in love with you—the real you, the oddball who loves rivers and stones and silence—those people will remember you forever. Everyone else doesn't matter."

She walked north out of the stone circle, her figure disappearing into the morning mist as quietly as she'd appeared.

Sefiathan sat by his rekindled fire, Thessaly's words settling into his understanding. An oddball. Someone who loves differently. Someone whose strange magic is precisely what makes them unforgettable.

He thought about the ways he loved: the careful arrangement of camp, the attention to small details, the songs for forests and carved birds for strangers. The way he'd sat in the clearing for ten days, healing. The way he'd spent hours completing a melody no one else would hear. The way he noticed things—moss patterns and bird calls and the exact quality of morning light through trees.

None of it was normal love. None of it looked like romance or conventional friendship or the kinds of connection people wrote ballads about.

But it was love nonetheless. His kind of love. Odd and intense and sideways.

And maybe—maybe that was okay. Maybe even good.

The stones sang around him, and Sefiathan hummed along, his melody weaving through their wind-music. Not trying to match it, not trying to make his song sound like their song. Just adding his voice to the harmony, strange and imperfect and entirely his own.

Thessaly had called him an oddball like it was a compliment. Like being strange was something to embrace rather than hide.

What if she was right?

What if all these years of trying to love normally, trying to connect in ways that made sense to other people, trying to hide his sideways intensity—what if that had been the actual problem?

What if his strange magic was exactly what some people needed?

Not everyone. Thessaly had been clear about that. Not everyone would understand or appreciate his odd way of moving through the world. But the ones who did—the ugly bird, the silent woman, Maren, Thessaly herself—those people would never forget him.

Sefiathan spent the day at the Singing Stones, tending his camp with the same careful attention Thessaly had noticed. Not hiding it now, not trying to make it seem less intense. Just—being himself. The person who arranged rocks with intention and noticed the exact pattern of lichen on stone and spent hours listening to wind make music.

That evening, as the sun set and painted the stones in gold and orange, Sefiathan hummed his melody for the first time at full volume. Not hiding it, not apologizing for its strangeness, just offering it to the stones and the wind and the empty meadow.

And the stones sang back, their wind-music weaving through his human-music, creating something that hadn't existed before. Not better than either alone, just—different. Strange. Memorable.

His kind of magic.

The magic of oddballs who love intensely and sideways and notice things other people miss.

Sefiathan fell asleep that night with Thessaly's words echoing in his mind: *Those who do will never forget.*

He'd spent twenty-seven years trying to be forgettable. Trying to blend in, to love normally, to hide his strangeness.

What if instead he just—stopped?

What if he let himself be odd and intense and sideways, and trusted that the right people would recognize it as magic?

What if being unforgettable was better than being normal?

The stones sang their answer through the night, wind playing them like instruments designed for exactly this purpose. And Sefiathan, sleeping in their circle, dreamed of rivers and birds and all the strange ways there were to love the world.
