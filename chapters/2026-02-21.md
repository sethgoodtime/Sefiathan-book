**Day 52 — February 21, 2026**

Sefiathan woke with the anger still there, coiled and waiting. Not as hot as yesterday, but present—a weight in his chest that followed him into the morning. He'd half-expected it to burn itself out overnight, to wake up resolved or peaceful or at least neutral. Instead it was just there, patient and persistent.

He thought about what would happen if he didn't deal with it. If he just let it sit. Let it calcify into something permanent.

The worst thing wasn't the anger itself—he was learning that much. The worst thing would be carrying it so long it became part of his architecture. Building his days around it. Letting it shape every interaction, every decision, every moment of potential connection. Becoming the angry person instead of the person who sometimes felt angry.

He could see how that would happen. How easy it would be to feed this feeling until it grew large enough to justify everything. Every withdrawal, every sharp word, every burned bridge. The anger would make sense of it all. Would provide a story where he was wronged and therefore righteous in his bitterness.

His father's face came to mind—that particular expression he'd wear when Sefiathan tried to explain something he was struggling with. Not quite contempt. More like disappointment mixed with confusion, as if Sefiathan was a problem he'd never figured out how to solve. That look had carved grooves in him over the years. Had taught him to stop explaining, stop trying, stop asking for understanding.

And his mother, always gentle with everyone except somehow unable to reach him. He'd watched her tend her garden with more tenderness than she'd ever shown him, had heard her speak to plants in tones she never used with her son. It had hurt in a way he'd never quite been able to articulate. Still hurt.

The worst thing that could happen if he didn't deal with this anger would be spending the rest of his life building shrines to these hurts. Preserving them. Keeping them fresh and raw so he'd never forget, never forgive, never risk being hurt again. He'd be safe. Defended. Completely alone with his carefully maintained grievances.

He sat up. The tent felt too small suddenly, the air too close. He needed to move.

Outside, the morning was grey and cold. Calantha was already up, building a fire with that efficient grace she brought to everything. She glanced at him, registered something in his face, said nothing. Just moved aside slightly, making space near the growing flames.

Sefiathan sat. Held his hands toward the heat.

"I'm angry at people who aren't here," he said. Not because she'd asked. Because the words wanted out and holding them in felt like the exact wrong choice.

Calantha added another piece of wood to the fire. "That's the hardest kind."

"Why?"

"Can't yell at them. Can't make them understand. Can't do anything except be angry at the memory of them." She settled back, watched the flames catch. "Anger needs somewhere to go. When the person isn't present to receive it, it just circles back to you."

"So what do I do with it?"

"Name it." She said it simply, like it was obvious. "Say the thing out loud. The fear hiding under the anger. The worst thing that could happen if you don't deal with it. Speak its full dimensions and watch it shrink."

Sefiathan stared at the fire. The worst thing. He'd been circling it all morning without quite touching it.

"I'm afraid I'll become like my father," he said. Let the words be stark and true. "Hard. Dismissive. Unable to see people for who they actually are. I'm afraid the anger will teach me to protect myself by being cruel. By deciding everyone else is the problem so I never have to look at my own failures."

The words hung in the cold air. Felt too big. Too revealing.

Calantha was quiet for a long moment. Then: "That's a real fear."

"I know."

"But it's not happening right now."

"Not yet."

"Not yet," she agreed. "But you're here. Naming it. That's not what your father would do." She glanced at him. "The fact that you're afraid of becoming him means you're paying attention to the ways you could. That's different than just becoming it."

Sefiathan watched the fire. Thought about his father, who'd never seemed afraid of anything except softness. Who'd built walls so high he couldn't see over them anymore. Who'd decided early that certain people were worth his time and certain people weren't, and Sefiathan had fallen on the wrong side of that division.

"I don't want to be him," Sefiathan said. "But I also don't want to spend my whole life bending myself into shapes to avoid being him. Swallowing every hurt so I stay soft. Smiling through pain so I stay approachable. Making myself smaller so I never risk being hard."

"Then don't."

"It's not that simple."

"It is." Calantha poked at the fire, redistributing the wood. "You can be angry and not become him. You can name your hurt without building your life around it. You can say 'my father failed me' without making that failure your entire story."

"How do you know?"

"Because I'm watching you do it right now." She looked at him fully. "You're angry. You named it. You're sitting with it instead of either swallowing it or weaponizing it. That's already different than becoming him."

Sefiathan felt something in his chest loosen slightly. Not the anger—that was still there. But the fear underneath it. The terror that feeling this anger meant he was already becoming the thing he feared.

"I'm angry at my father," he said. Testing the words. "I'm angry that he never saw me. Never tried to understand me. Just decided I was disappointing and treated me accordingly. I'm angry at my mother for being so distant. At Mira for fitting so naturally into the space I was supposed to fill. I'm angry at all of them for failing me in their different ways and I'm tired of pretending that's fine."

The words felt dangerous. Felt like permission to hold grudges, to stay bitter, to refuse forgiveness. But they also felt true.

Calantha nodded. "Good. Now what are you going to do with it?"

"I don't know."

"You don't have to know. You just have to choose whether holding onto it serves you."

Sefiathan sat with that. The anger was real. Valid. Worth feeling. But was holding onto it—feeding it, maintaining it, building his life around it—actually helping? Or just giving him someone to blame?

"The worst thing," he said slowly, "is that I'd spend the rest of my life being right. Right about how my father failed me. Right about all the ways I was hurt. Right about who to blame. And being right would feel so good that I'd never have to risk being wrong. Never have to try again. Never have to be vulnerable with anyone because I'd already proven they'd just hurt me."

"That is the worst thing," Calantha agreed. "Being so committed to being right about your pain that you forget to live past it."

The fire crackled between them. Somewhere in the gathering, someone laughed—a bright, uncomplicated sound. Sefiathan felt the anger still there in his chest, but smaller now. Less consuming. More like information than identity.

He could hold onto this. Could nurse it. Could let it become the lens through which he saw everything. Could spend his life being right about how he was wronged.

Or he could feel it. Really feel it, all the way through. And then choose to keep moving.

The anger didn't vanish. Didn't resolve into peace or forgiveness or understanding. Just sat there, acknowledged and named, shrinking to its actual size instead of the size his fear had made it.

"Thank you," he said to Calantha.

"For what?"

"For letting me name it without trying to fix it."

She smiled slightly. "Monsters vanish when exposed to light. But only if you actually turn the light on them instead of keeping them safely hidden."

Sefiathan nodded. Stood. The anger was still there. Would probably be there for a while. But it was just anger now. Not a monster. Not a shrine. Not his entire future.

Just a feeling that wanted to be felt.

He could live with that.
