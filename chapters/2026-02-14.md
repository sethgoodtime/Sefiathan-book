**Day 45 — February 14, 2026**

Sefiathan spent the morning watching Korrin teach a group of young wind-readers how to properly care for their horses. Not because he needed to know—though he was picking up information despite himself—but because watching Korrin work was oddly restful. The centaur didn't explain things twice. Didn't over-justify his methods. Just showed them how to check hooves for stones, how to brush in the direction of the coat, how to read a horse's mood from the set of its ears. Simple, practical knowledge delivered without ceremony.

One of the younger wind-readers—a girl maybe sixteen—kept asking why. Why brush this direction and not that one? Why check the hooves before riding instead of after? Why approach from the left side? Each question seemed to make Korrin slightly more amused, though his face barely changed.

"Because that's how you do it," he finally said, not unkindly.

"But there must be a reason—"

"There is. The reason is: this works. You can spend your whole life excavating the why, or you can learn the skill and get on with living." He patted the horse's flank. "Sometimes the answer to why is just 'because someone figured it out before you were born and it's been working fine ever since.'"

The girl looked dissatisfied but nodded. Sefiathan understood the feeling. His mind did the same thing—took every piece of information and immediately started pulling at its threads, looking for the deeper explanation, the hidden logic, the underlying structure. As if understanding the theory of something was more important than just knowing how to do it.

He'd been doing it all week with Orvenna's teachings. She'd tell him to listen to the wind, and his mind would immediately start cataloging: what kind of wind, what time of day, what's the difference between surface wind and deep wind, how do you distinguish signal from noise, what's the methodology, what's the framework. Building a mental library of how wind-reading worked instead of just learning to read the wind.

Endless analysis as its own form of avoidance. Exactly what yesterday's fight with Tavis had been about, actually—both of them so busy understanding and optimizing that neither was just being present.

After the lesson, Korrin came over to where Sefiathan was sitting. "Learn anything?"

"That I ask too many questions."

"That's not what I was teaching." Korrin lowered himself to the ground with the careful grace of someone whose body was both powerful and complicated. "But yes. You do."

They sat in comfortable silence. The gathering was quieter today—people had dispersed to their various activities, the urgency of the Frostmere reading apparently satisfied for now. Somewhere across the ice, Sefiathan could hear Calantha laughing at something. Tavis and a few others were building some kind of windbreak structure, Tavis explaining geometry while actually just helping instead of optimizing.

"Can I ask you something?" Sefiathan said.

Korrin smiled. "See, there you go."

"Fair." Sefiathan pulled his cloak tighter against the cold. "Why did you leave your herd? You never actually told me."

"No. I didn't."

Sefiathan waited. Korrin was someone who would answer in his own time, if he answered at all. Pushing would just make him more silent.

"I was supposed to be a teacher," Korrin said eventually. "That's the role I was born into. My family's known for teaching—philosophy, history, horsemanship. All the things young centaurs need to know." He picked up a small stone, rolled it between his fingers. "And I was good at it. Patient. Clear. Everyone said I had the gift."

"But?"

"But I kept trying to teach them why instead of how. Kept giving them the theory, the deep understanding, the historical context. Wanted them to truly comprehend each lesson instead of just learning it." He tossed the stone. "Most of them just needed to know how to saddle a horse or defend themselves or read the stars. They didn't need my dissertation on the philosophical implications of equestrianism."

Sefiathan felt that land in his chest. The recognition of someone else making his exact mistake, just years earlier.

"One day a student asked me how to tie a particular knot," Korrin continued. "Essential knot—could save your life in a fall. And I started explaining the physics of rope tension, the history of knot-tying techniques, the mathematical elegance of the pattern. Twenty minutes later, she still couldn't tie the knot. She was crying from frustration. I was still explaining." He was quiet for a moment. "That's when I realized I was teaching to make myself feel useful, not to actually help anyone."

"So you left."

"So I left. Figured I needed to learn how to just be instead of always performing expertise." He looked at Sefiathan. "You do the same thing. Not with teaching, but with yourself. You can't just experience something—you have to understand it, categorize it, figure out exactly where it fits in your internal framework. Can't just be sad. Have to know why you're sad, whether the sadness is justified, what it means about your character, how it compares to previous sadnesses."

Sefiathan opened his mouth to defend himself, then realized that would just prove Korrin's point. "Yeah," he said instead. "I do that."

"It's exhausting, isn't it? Living in the question instead of the answer?"

"The answer feels like giving up."

"Or," Korrin said, "the answer feels like arriving. Like you can stop working so hard to understand everything and just start living it." He stood, brushed ice from his coat. "Not everything needs to be excavated. Sometimes the surface is enough."

He walked away before Sefiathan could respond. Which was probably intentional. Korrin had a habit of delivering observations and then leaving Sefiathan to sit with them.

The wind picked up, carrying voices from across the ice. Someone was singing—not a formal song, just idle melody while working. It reminded Sefiathan of his own song, the one he'd made without understanding why. Just following instinct, letting the melody happen instead of architecting it.

Maybe that was the point. Maybe wisdom wasn't about having all the answers. Maybe it was about knowing when to stop asking questions and just live in the uncertainty. Just be in the moment without needing to justify or explain or understand it.

His mind immediately wanted to analyze that thought, pull it apart, examine whether he truly believed it or was just performing belief. He caught himself doing it and almost laughed.

Even now. Even understanding the problem, he was doing it.

Somewhere deep under the ice, that presence hummed. Not asking why. Just being.
