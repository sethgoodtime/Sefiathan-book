# SEFIATHAN'S JOURNEY

--- 2026-02-26 ---
**Day 57 — February 26, 2026**

The morning after the confrontation with Jessith, Sefiathan woke with a different kind of tension in his chest. Not the coiled-spring pressure of unexpressed words, but something more specific. Something that pointed directly at Tavis.

He'd been watching it happen for days now. The way Tavis would ask for help with basic tasks—fetching water, organizing his teaching materials, preparing food—and then struggle through them anyway when the help never quite materialized. The way he'd mention feeling overwhelmed and wait hopefully for someone to offer solutions, support, anything. The way his helplessness had initially seemed endearing, vulnerable even, and had slowly curdled into something exhausting.

Sefiathan had been trying to help. Had been showing up, offering assistance, trying to anticipate what Tavis needed before he had to ask. And somehow it never seemed like enough. There was always another crisis, another overwhelming task, another moment where Tavis looked at him with those wide, uncertain eyes and waited for Sefiathan to fix it.

It had felt like care at first. Like the right thing to do. Now it just felt like work.

He found Tavis near his tent, sitting cross-legged on the ground with papers scattered around him in apparent chaos. The young teacher looked up as Sefiathan approached, and his expression immediately brightened with relief.

"Oh thank the winds, I was hoping you'd come by." Tavis gestured helplessly at the papers. "I'm trying to organize my notes from yesterday's session but I can't remember what order I covered things in and it's all getting mixed up and I don't know where to start and—"

"Tavis." Sefiathan's voice came out flatter than he intended. "Stop."

Tavis blinked. "What?"

"I'm not helping you organize your notes." The words felt harsh in his mouth, but Sefiathan pushed through. "You're perfectly capable of doing it yourself."

"But I don't know where to start. It's overwhelming and I thought maybe you could—"

"I'm sure it is overwhelming." Sefiathan sat down across from him, not close enough to touch the papers. "But that doesn't mean I need to fix it for you. You'll figure it out. Or you won't. Either way, it's yours to handle."

Tavis's expression shifted—confusion, then hurt. "I thought we were friends. Friends help each other."

"We are friends." Sefiathan felt the anger from yesterday still present, still sharp. "But friendship isn't the same as you being helpless and me solving your problems. That's not care. That's me doing your emotional labor for you."

"I'm not trying to make you do my emotional labor." Tavis's voice had gone defensive. "I'm just asking for help. There's nothing wrong with asking for help."

"You're right. There's nothing wrong with asking for help." Sefiathan kept his voice level. "But you don't ask for help. You present yourself as helpless and wait for someone to rescue you. Those aren't the same thing."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Sefiathan gestured at the papers. "Right now, you're sitting in front of a task that you're perfectly capable of handling. It's tedious and boring and you don't want to do it. So instead of just doing it, you've turned it into a crisis that requires someone else to step in and solve. That's not asking for help. That's manufacturing helplessness."

Tavis stared at him like he'd been slapped. "I can't believe you're saying this. I thought you understood. I thought you were different from—" He stopped. Started again, his voice smaller. "I thought you actually cared."

And there it was. The trump card. The suggestion that refusing to fix someone's problems for them was the same as not caring. That boundaries were cruelty. That saying no meant abandoning them.

Sefiathan felt the old impulse rise up—the urge to backpedal, to soften, to apologize for being too harsh. To reassure Tavis that of course he cared, of course he'd help, of course he didn't mean it that way.

But he thought about yesterday. About standing his ground with Jessith. About the raw words he'd screamed at Korrin. About the careful words that hadn't been working because they weren't true.

"I do care," he said quietly. "That's why I'm saying this. Because watching you perform helplessness is exhausting, and I've mistaken exhaustion for caring when really it's just me enabling you to avoid growing up."

Tavis flinched. His hands moved to the papers, defensive. "I'm not performing anything. I genuinely struggle with this stuff. Not everyone finds organization easy. Not everyone can just figure it out on their own."

"You're right. Not everyone can. But you can." Sefiathan didn't soften his tone. "I've watched you teach. I've watched you read wind currents and adjust your lessons on the fly based on what students need. I've watched you handle actual crises—storms, emergencies, moments where people's safety was at stake. You're not helpless. You just act helpless when there are easier, boring tasks you don't want to handle yourself."

"So I'm not allowed to struggle? I'm not allowed to need help?"

"You're allowed to struggle. You're allowed to need help. But you're not allowed to make your struggles everyone else's responsibility." Sefiathan felt the words getting sharper, more precise. "When you present yourself as helpless, you're not asking for help. You're asking someone to take over. To do it for you. To protect you from the discomfort of figuring it out yourself."

Tavis's eyes were shining now, tears threatening. "You sound just like my father. He used to say the same thing. That I was too sensitive. That I needed to grow up. That I was manipulating people with my emotions."

"Maybe he was right."

The words hung there. Brutal and uncompromising. Tavis looked at Sefiathan like he'd stabbed him. Like they'd crossed some line that couldn't be uncrossed.

"I can't believe you just said that." Tavis's voice was shaking. "After everything I've shared with you. After all the times I've been vulnerable and honest and—"

"You've been vulnerable, yes." Sefiathan interrupted. "But honest? No. You haven't been honest about how you use your helplessness to get people to do things for you. You haven't been honest about how you've turned your sensitivity into a shield against accountability. You've mistaken performing vulnerability for actual intimacy."

Tavis stood abruptly. The papers scattered further, some catching the wind. He didn't move to gather them. "I don't have to listen to this. I came to this gathering to learn and grow and find community, not to be attacked by someone I thought was my friend."

"I'm not attacking you." Sefiathan stayed seated, kept his voice calm. "I'm telling you the truth you don't want to hear. The truth that everyone else has probably been too polite to say. That your helplessness is exhausting. That fixing you is not the same as loving you. That you won't grow if people keep solving your problems for you."

"Then I guess we're done here." Tavis turned to leave, then stopped. Looked back at Sefiathan with something like betrayal in his eyes. "You know what? You're right. I thought you were different. I thought you actually understood what it was like to struggle. But you're just like everyone else. As soon as it gets inconvenient, as soon as it requires actual patience and support, you bail."

He walked away. Left the papers scattered on the ground. Left Sefiathan sitting there with the sharp edges of truth still cutting both ways.

Sefiathan didn't move to gather the papers. Didn't call after Tavis to apologize or soften what he'd said. Just sat there feeling the weight of what had just happened.

He'd drawn a line. Had refused to keep fixing someone who didn't want to be fixed, who wanted to be rescued. Had said the hard truth directly instead of carefully managing it into something more palatable.

And it had cost him. Maybe the friendship. Definitely the easy companionship they'd built over the past weeks.

But as Sefiathan sat there watching Tavis disappear into the gathering, he didn't feel the crushing guilt he'd expected. Didn't feel like he'd done something terrible that needed to be apologized for.

He felt tired. Sad, maybe. But also something like relief.

He couldn't keep fixing people who didn't want to fix themselves. Couldn't keep mistaking exhaustion for love. Couldn't keep enabling helplessness and calling it care.

Tavis's father might have been cruel. Might have said those things in ways that wounded rather than helped. But the core truth remained: Tavis was using his sensitivity as a shield. Was performing helplessness to avoid the harder work of actually growing.

And Sefiathan was done being complicit in that performance.

He stood finally, left the papers where they lay. Walked back toward his tent feeling something solid settle in his chest. Not peace. Not satisfaction. Just the quiet certainty that he'd said what needed saying.

Even if it cost him.

Even if Tavis never forgave him.

Even if everyone else thought he was too harsh, too demanding, too unwilling to accommodate genuine struggle.

He'd told the truth. Clear and direct and uncompromising.

And sometimes that was all you could do.
