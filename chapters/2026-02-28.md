**Day 59 — February 28, 2026**

Sefiathan woke to the realization that he'd been holding warmth at arm's length for months now. Maybe longer. Maybe his whole life.

The thought arrived fully formed, like it had been waiting just outside his awareness for the right moment to announce itself. He lay in his bedroll watching condensation form on the tent fabric above him, and the truth settled with quiet certainty: he knew people cared about him. His mother. Korrin. Calantha. Even Maren at the Crossroads Post in her gruff, practical way. He knew it intellectually, could list the evidence if asked. But knowing someone cared and actually feeling it—letting it land, letting it warm him—those were entirely different things.

The walls he'd built weren't just keeping threats out. They were trapping warmth inside too, unexpressed and unshared, where it couldn't actually reach anyone. Including him.

He thought about yesterday's realization with Calantha. How he'd been seeking validation from everyone else instead of trusting his own knowing. How exhausting that constant checking had become. But there was something else underneath that pattern. A deeper architecture. He'd built those walls so carefully that even when people offered genuine care, it hit the barrier and slid away. Their warmth never actually reached him. His silence—the careful holding back, the measured responses, the refusal to let anyone see what he was guarding—read as judgment to them. Not protection.

It was easier to keep everyone at a safe distance. To stay self-sufficient and contained. To not need things from people, not ask for care, not show the messy, uncertain parts that might make them uncomfortable. He'd told himself that was strength. Independence. Not burdening others with his complications.

But it was also isolation. The kind that made you colder over time without noticing until someone pointed out you were barely letting any warmth in at all.

Sefiathan dressed and stepped out into morning air sharp enough to sting. The gathering was quieter than usual—people still in their tents or huddled around cooking fires in small, tight groups. He spotted Korrin near one of the larger fires and made his way over, settling onto the log beside him without asking.

"You look like you're chewing on something uncomfortable," Korrin observed.

"I think I've been doing the walls wrong." Sefiathan held his hands toward the fire, letting the heat sink into his palms. "I built them to keep threats out. But they're also keeping everything else out. Including warmth I actually need."

Korrin nodded slowly. "Walls do that. They're not selective. They just keep things at distance."

"People know I care about them. I show up, I help when they need it, I'm present. But I don't think they feel it. My caring. Because I keep it behind the wall where it's safe." Sefiathan felt the words coming clearer now, more certain. "And my silence—the way I don't share what I'm actually feeling or struggling with—it doesn't read as strength to them. It reads like judgment. Like I'm holding myself apart because they're not worth the mess."

"Are they wrong?"

The question landed sharp. Sefiathan wanted to immediately say yes, of course they were wrong. But he sat with it instead, feeling for the honest answer underneath the defensive one.

"Maybe not entirely," he admitted. "I do hold myself apart. I just thought I was doing it to protect them from my complications. But maybe I was really just protecting myself from having to be seen."

A woman approached the fire—someone Sefiathan had seen around the gathering but never really talked to. She nodded at Korrin, then glanced at Sefiathan with something like hesitation in her expression.

"Can I ask you something?" She directed the question at Sefiathan, her tone careful.

"Sure."

"The other day, you helped me carry water when my shoulder was hurting. You were kind about it. But then you left immediately after and I got the sense that... I don't know. That I'd done something wrong. Or that you were annoyed you had to help." She spoke quickly, like she'd been building up to this. "I wanted to thank you properly but you seemed like you wanted to be somewhere else."

Sefiathan felt the observation settle with uncomfortable accuracy. He remembered that interaction. Had helped carry the water, had made sure she was alright, then had excused himself because staying felt too vulnerable somehow. Like if he lingered, she might see more than he wanted to share. Might ask questions he didn't want to answer. Might require more of him than he was ready to give.

"You didn't do anything wrong," he said slowly. "I was trying to help without being intrusive. But I see how that could read as judgment instead. Like I couldn't wait to leave."

"Were you annoyed?"

"No. I was uncomfortable. But not because of you." He made himself hold her gaze. "I have a hard time staying present when someone might want to connect beyond the immediate task. It feels too vulnerable. So I help and then I leave before it can turn into something more."

The woman looked surprised by the honesty. "Oh. I thought you just didn't like me very much."

"It's not about liking you. It's about not knowing how to let people in beyond surface-level helpfulness." Sefiathan felt the truth of that settling. "I can show up for tasks. I'm good at being useful. But staying present for connection after the usefulness is done—that's harder. That requires showing more of myself than I'm usually comfortable with."

She nodded slowly, processing. "Well. Thank you for the help anyway. And for explaining. I appreciate it."

She moved on to another fire. Korrin was watching Sefiathan with an expression that might have been approval or amusement or both.

"That's the warmth," Korrin said. "Right there. The explaining. The letting her see why you left instead of letting her assume it was judgment. That's honey drizzled on a friend."

Sefiathan felt something shift in his chest. Such a small thing—just explaining his own discomfort instead of leaving her to interpret his silence however she wanted. But it had changed the shape of the interaction entirely. Had turned what she'd experienced as rejection into something understandable. Had let her glimpse what he'd been guarding instead of just feeling the cold wall between them.

"I do that constantly," he said quietly. "Help people but then disappear before it can turn into actual connection. And they're left thinking I was just being polite, or that I was annoyed, or that I don't actually like them. When really I'm just scared of being seen beyond the helpful tasks."

"Then stop disappearing." Korrin's tone was matter-of-fact. "Stay for five minutes after the task is done. Let people see that you're uncomfortable with connection but trying anyway. Let them glimpse what you're guarding. That's what lets warmth through."

Sefiathan thought about that. About all the times he'd helped someone and immediately excused himself. All the times he'd carefully deflected personal questions or changed the subject when conversation got too close to vulnerable territory. All the times he'd treated connection like a threat to be managed instead of warmth to be received.

He wasn't actually protecting people from his complications. He was protecting himself from being known. From having to let someone see the uncertain, messy, struggling parts. From risking that they might see all of him and decide he was too much work, too complicated, not worth the effort.

The walls kept threats out, yes. But they also kept warmth trapped inside where it couldn't reach anyone. Where his caring stayed theoretical instead of felt. Where his presence read as judgment instead of shy, awkward attempts at connection.

Later that morning, Sefiathan deliberately sought out Calantha. Found her near her tent, sorting through teaching materials. He sat down nearby without asking, but instead of waiting for her to speak first or for a task to present itself, he just stayed present. Let the silence be comfortable instead of something to fill or escape.

After a few minutes, Calantha looked up. "You need something?"

"No. I'm just sitting here." Sefiathan felt the vulnerability of that admission. "Practicing staying present without a reason. Without usefulness to justify being here."

Calantha's expression softened. "That's actually really hard for you, isn't it? Just being present without a task."

"Extremely hard. It feels presumptuous. Like I'm taking up space I haven't earned the right to occupy."

"You know that's not how friendship works, right? You don't have to earn the space. You just take it up by being present. That's the whole thing." She set down her materials and turned to face him fully. "This is what I've been waiting for. Not your help. Just you, showing up without armor."

Sefiathan felt something warm and uncomfortable settle in his chest. This was it—the honey drizzled on a friend. Not grand gestures or perfect words or useful tasks. Just presence. Just letting someone glimpse what he'd been guarding. Just staying for five minutes past comfortable and letting the awkwardness be visible instead of hiding it behind careful walls.

"I'm really bad at this," he said.

"I know. It's endearing." Calantha grinned. "Stay anyway. Tell me what you're guarding that's so precious you have to keep it behind walls."

And Sefiathan stayed. Let the walls crack just enough to let some warmth through. Discovered that being seen was terrifying but also surprisingly necessary. That people did know he cared, but they needed to feel it too. That his silence wasn't protection—it was just cold distance that made everyone lonelier.

The walls had kept threats out. But they'd also kept him from ever actually warming anyone with what he'd been carefully holding inside.

It was time to let some of that warmth leak through.
