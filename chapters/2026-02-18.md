**Day 49 — February 18, 2026**

Sefiatha needed to talk to Korrin. Not because something was wrong, but because something was right and he didn't know what to do with it. That felt like the kind of thing you brought to someone who'd proven they could handle your unfiltered thoughts without trying to fix them.

He found Korrin near the edge of the gathering, working through a series of stretches that looked more like meditation than exercise. The centaur's movements were slow, deliberate, each position held long enough to mean something. Sefiathan waited until Korrin shifted to a new stance before approaching.

"Can I talk to you?" The words came out less filtered than he'd planned. No preamble, no careful setup. Just the raw request.

Korrin finished his stretch, settled back into standing. "That's what you're doing."

"I mean really talk. Not—" Sefiathan gestured vaguely. "Not the edited version."

"When have you ever given me an edited version?"

"Always." The admission surprised him. "I edit everything. I say things and while I'm saying them I'm already adjusting the next part based on how you're reacting. Trying to fit what you might want to hear instead of what I actually think."

Korrin studied him for a long moment. "And today you want to try something different."

"I don't know if I can."

"Well." Korrin moved toward a flat section of ground, settled himself in that way he had—half-sitting, weight distributed across four legs in a configuration that looked both casual and completely stable. "Let's find out."

Sefiathan sat across from him. The words that wanted to come out felt too raw, too unfinished. He was supposed to organize them first. Make them coherent. Present them in a way that made sense. But that was the editing, wasn't it? The constant adjustment to fit what he thought the other person could handle.

"I'm tired of performing," he said. Let the words be rough. "I'm tired of trying to say things the right way. Tired of watching your face to see if I should keep going or change direction. Tired of—of being so aware of the space I'm taking up that I forget what I was trying to say in the first place."

Korrin didn't react. Didn't nod encouragingly or offer validation. Just listened.

"And the thing is, I don't even know what I'd say if I wasn't editing. Because I've been doing it so long that the editing happens before I'm aware I'm doing it. Like—you asked me yesterday how I was feeling and I said fine because that's what came out, but I wasn't fine. I was frustrated and confused and kind of angry but none of those felt safe to say so I said fine instead. And I didn't even realize I was lying until later."

The words were tumbling out now, unpracticed and unpolished. He'd started this wanting to be unfiltered and now he was actually doing it and it felt terrifying.

"I think I'm afraid," Sefiathan continued. "That if I say what I actually think, what I actually feel, it'll be too much. Too intense. Too strange. And you'll—not leave, maybe, but you'll start managing me. Like I'm something fragile that needs to be handled carefully. Or you'll decide I'm more work than I'm worth."

"Are you done?" Korrin asked.

"I don't know."

"Then keep going."

Sefiathan looked at the frozen ground between them. "I want to be the kind of person who just says what they mean. Who doesn't twist themselves into shapes trying to fit what everyone else needs them to be. But I don't know how. And I'm worried that even trying means I'll say something wrong or too much or—"

"You're doing it again," Korrin said.

"What?"

"Watching my face. Adjusting based on what you think I want to hear." But his tone wasn't critical. "You started strong. Stopped editing. Then caught yourself doing it and started hedging again."

Sefiathan felt his face heat. "See? This is what I mean. I can't even talk about not editing without editing."

"So stop."

"It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?" Korrin shifted slightly, redistributing his weight. "You're making this more complicated than it needs to be. You want to say what you mean? Say it. I'll tell you if I can't handle it. And if I can't handle it, that's my problem, not yours."

"But what if—"

"What if nothing." Korrin's voice was firm but not harsh. "You're creating hypothetical disasters to avoid the actual risk of just talking. What if I leave? What if I think you're too much? What if I start managing you? Those are all possibilities. They're also all things I could do whether you're filtered or not. So what's the editing actually protecting you from?"

Sefiathan sat with that. The answer felt obvious and impossible at the same time. "From being rejected for who I actually am instead of who I'm pretending to be."

"And you think pretending is working."

"It's worked so far."

"Has it?" Korrin waited. "You've got friends who see through the act. A teacher who calls you on your avoidance. A whole gathering of people who seem to like you just fine despite all your supposedly terrible unfiltered qualities. So what exactly has the editing earned you except exhaustion?"

The question sat between them, heavy and unavoidable.

Sefiathan thought about Calantha recognizing something in his face yesterday. Thought about Orvenna saying good when he didn't apologize. Thought about Tavis burning seventeen pages of preparation because the preparation was the problem. Thought about everyone in his life who'd somehow seen past the performance and stuck around anyway.

"I don't know who I am without the editing," he admitted. "I've been doing it so long I'm not sure there's anything underneath. Like maybe the performance is all there is and if I stop I'll just be—empty. Nothing."

"That's dramatic."

"I'm being honest."

"I know. That's how I know you're not empty." Korrin's expression was something close to amusement. "Empty people don't spend this much energy trying to figure out what they're protecting. They just protect it."

Sefiathan wanted to argue. Wanted to explain that Korrin didn't understand the depth of his particular dysfunction. But that was more editing, wasn't it? More controlling the narrative. More trying to manage how he was perceived instead of just existing and letting Korrin perceive whatever he perceived.

"I think I'm afraid you'll find me boring," he said. Let it be simple and true. "If I stop performing. If I'm just—myself. Without the jokes and the bright smile and the constant adjustment to be interesting enough to keep around. I think you'll realize I'm actually incredibly dull and you only tolerated me because I was working so hard to be entertaining."

"Is that what you actually think?"

"I don't know. Maybe." He made himself look at Korrin directly. "What if the unfiltered version of me isn't worth knowing?"

"Then I'll tell you." Korrin said it like a fact, not a threat. "If you bore me, you'll know. If you're too much, you'll know. If you say something I can't handle, you'll know. But you don't get to decide those things for me in advance. You don't get to pre-emptively edit yourself to avoid hypothetical rejection."

"That's terrifying."

"Yes."

They sat in silence. The gathering continued around them—voices, movement, the ordinary sounds of people existing together. No one watching their conversation. No one waiting for Sefiathan to say the right thing or be the right amount of present.

"What if I don't know where to start?" Sefiathan asked.

"You already started." Korrin gestured at him. "Everything you just said? That was unfiltered. Messy and repetitive and honest. That's what it looks like."

"It didn't feel profound."

"It wasn't supposed to." Korrin stood, stretched. "You want to practice saying what you mean? Stop trying to make it profound. Stop trying to make it perfect. Just say the thing that's in your head and let it be what it is. Sometimes it'll be boring. Sometimes it'll be too much. Sometimes it'll be exactly right. You don't get to know in advance."

Sefiathan stood too, feeling slightly unsteady. "Will you tell me? If I'm being too much?"

"Yes."

"Promise?"

"I promise I'll tell you if you're being too much. I also promise you'll know when I'm lying to protect your feelings because I'm terrible at it." Korrin started walking back toward the gathering proper. "Now stop asking for reassurance and go do literally anything else with your day."

Sefiathan watched him go, then stood there alone with his unfiltered thoughts.

They weren't profound. They weren't perfectly organized. They were just thoughts—messy and contradictory and honest.

Maybe that was enough.
