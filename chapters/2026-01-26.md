Day 26 - January 26, 2026
Sefiathan woke slowly, without urgency. The second morning of doing nothing felt easier than the first. His body knew now that stillness was allowed.
He lay in his bedroll watching light change the color of the stones—gray to amber to gold as the sun climbed. The wind played its morning song, lower and more resonant than yesterday's afternoon melody. Everything was the same. Everything was different. The world kept being itself without requiring his participation.
Eventually he rose, tended to his body's needs without ceremony, ate without making it an event. The rhythm of basic maintenance. The animal simplicity of staying alive.
He was gathering wood near the meadow's edge—not hoarding it, just collecting enough for tonight—when he saw the centaur.
They were far off, crossing the northern portion of the meadow at an angle that would take them past the Singing Stones without entering the circle. Four-legged and sure-footed, moving with the steady pace of someone who had distance to cover and wasn't stopping for distractions.
Sefiathan watched without calling out. The centaur would pass or not pass. Would notice him or not notice him. It wasn't his job to make it into something.
But the centaur shifted direction slightly, adjusting their path toward the stone circle. Not dramatically—just a gentle correction, like water finding a channel. They stopped at the circle's edge, a respectful distance from Sefiathan's camp.
"Morning," the centaur called. Their voice was warm, weather-worn. "You've been here a while."
"Few days," Sefiathan agreed.
"Good place for it." The centaur didn't move closer, didn't invite themselves in. Just stood there, pack settled across their back, the morning light catching silver in their dark hair. "I'm Korrin. I pass through here every few months on my way north."
"Sefiathan."
Korrin nodded, seemed to be considering something. "You look like someone who's learning to do nothing."
It wasn't a question, but Sefiathan answered anyway. "Yeah. Spent yesterday being a plant."
"Best kind of day." Korrin adjusted their pack. "I'm heading to the Frostmere border—there's a gathering of wind-readers in a couple weeks. Nine days' walk if the weather holds."
They said it casually, not quite an invitation but not quite not-an-invitation either. Just information offered neutrally, the way you might mention the weather.
Sefiathan felt the old reflex rise—to figure out what Korrin wanted, to decode the social expectation, to determine the right response. But yesterday's plant-practice had left him slower, quieter. Less interested in performing correct behavior.
"I'm not sure where I'm going yet," he said honestly.
"Fair enough." Korrin's expression didn't change, didn't show disappointment or approval. "I'm resting here for an hour, then continuing north. You're welcome to walk with me if you decide that's where you're heading. If not, safe travels."
They walked to the far side of the circle and settled onto the ground with the ease of someone who'd done this hundreds of times. Pulled out food, ate without urgency. Just—existed. Present but not demanding presence.
Sefiathan returned to his camp and sat with the question. Not trying to decide, just holding it. Nine days to the Frostmere border. A gathering of wind-readers—people who were still learning, who admitted they didn't know what they were doing.
The old Sefiathan would have spiraled. Made lists of pros and cons. Worried about committing to the wrong path. Built elaborate justifications for any choice.
Today's Sefiathan just—sat with it. Let the question be a question. Let the uncertainty be uncertain.
He watched Korrin across the circle. The centaur wasn't trying to convince him, wasn't waiting anxiously for an answer. They'd made an offer and were now just—being. Resting before the next portion of their journey. Whether Sefiathan came along or didn't come along seemed genuinely irrelevant to Korrin's peace.
That was its own kind of teaching.
After maybe forty minutes, Sefiathan stood and started packing his things. Not frantically, not with the urgency of seizing an opportunity. Just—packing. Moving with the same unhurried care he'd brought to being a plant. If he finished before Korrin was ready to leave, he'd wait. If he didn't finish in time, he'd stay at the Singing Stones. Either way was fine.
He finished with time to spare. Rolled his blanket, secured his pack, ran through his mental checklist not anxiously but methodically. Then he walked across the circle to where Korrin was rising, stretching in that particular way centaurs did, all four legs working through the stiffness of sitting.
"I'll walk with you," Sefiathan said. "For a while, at least. See how it feels."
Korrin nodded, shouldering their pack. "Good enough."
They left the Singing Stones without ceremony. Sefiathan didn't stop to say goodbye to them, didn't turn back for one last look. The stones were what they were. They'd keep singing whether he was there to hear it or not.
The walking settled into an easy rhythm. Korrin moved faster than a human would walk but slower than they probably could, adjusting naturally to Sefiathan's two-legged pace. They didn't fill the silence with conversation. Just walked, steady and sure, north across the meadow toward distant hills.
Around midday they stopped to rest in the shade of a lone oak. Korrin unpacked food—some kind of dense honey-nut bar—and broke it in half without asking, offering a piece to Sefiathan.
"Thank you," Sefiathan said, accepting it.
They ate in comfortable silence. The bar was good—sweet and substantial. Real food made by someone who understood hunger.
"Thessaly said you were someone worth noticing," Korrin said after a while.
Sefiathan looked up, surprised. "You know Thessaly?"
"We cross paths occasionally. She came through three days ago, heading north. Mentioned there was an oddball at the Singing Stones who was learning to take up space." Korrin took a drink from their waterskin. "She's usually right about people."
"She called me an oddball," Sefiathan said. Not complaining, just confirming.
"High compliment, from Thessaly. She only notices the interesting ones." Korrin leaned back against the tree. "The gathering I'm heading to—it's specifically for people who don't have it figured out. Wind-readers who are still learning. Some of them have been coming for twenty years. The whole point is admitting you don't know."
"That's allowed?" The question came out more earnest than Sefiathan intended.
Korrin smiled. "It's required. Nobody who claims to have mastered wind-reading is welcome. Only the ones still humble enough to be students."
Sefiathan thought about that. A gathering where not-knowing was the price of admission. Where everyone was openly figuring it out, no one pretending they'd received instructions the others had missed.
"I spent yesterday doing nothing," he said. "Just being a plant. Absorbing light."
"Best practice there is." Korrin stood, brushing off their hands. "Everything important happens in the space between doing things. The wind-readers know that. They spend half their time sitting still, learning to do absolutely nothing."
They resumed walking. The landscape gradually shifted from meadow to rolling hills, grass giving way to scattered pines. Korrin pointed out landmarks without overwhelming him with information—a hawk riding thermals, a spring where they'd stop to refill water, a particular stand of trees that marked the edge of what Korrin considered "home territory."
By late afternoon they reached the northern spring Korrin had mentioned. A small pool fed by underground sources, surrounded by moss-covered rocks and young willows. The water was cold and tasted of minerals and distance.
Korrin set about making camp with practiced efficiency. Not rushing, not performing skill, just—doing what needed doing. Sefiathan helped where help made sense, stayed out of the way where it didn't.
As they built a small fire, Korrin spoke again. "You don't have to decide now whether you're coming all the way to the Frostmere. We're walking in the same direction. That's enough for today."
"What if I change my mind tomorrow?"
"Then you change your mind tomorrow." Korrin arranged stones around the fire with care. "The gathering will be there whether you come or not. I'll be fine either way. You'll be fine either way."
That certainty—that everyone would be fine regardless of what Sefiathan chose—felt radical. Like permission to stop treating every decision as if it determined his entire future.
"Everyone's just figuring it out," Sefiathan said, thinking of the day's theme without naming it directly.
"Yeah." Korrin started preparing food—wild onions, herbs they'd gathered near the spring. "Nobody has the instructions. Some people are just better at pretending they do."
They ate together as darkness fell, the fire warming a small circle against the cooling air. Korrin didn't press for conversation, didn't seem to need Sefiathan to be entertaining or insightful. Just—present. Another person sharing space.
Sefiathan thought about the Singing Stones, now hours behind them. About spending yesterday being a plant. About Thessaly calling him an oddball worth noticing. About prisons built from memories no one else carried.
He'd walked away from the stones without knowing where he was going. Was walking toward the Frostmere without committing to arriving there. And somehow that felt more honest than any certain plan he'd ever made.
"I might not know what I'm doing," he said into the firelight.
"None of us do," Korrin replied easily. "That's the whole point."
The fire crackled. The spring burbled nearby. Somewhere in the distance, a night bird called.
Sefiathan settled into his bedroll beside the fire, the uncertainty of his path feeling less like failure and more like—freedom. He'd walk north tomorrow because that's where his feet were pointed. Would reassess the day after. Would keep figuring it out the way everyone else was figuring it out.
Without instructions. Without certainty. Without pretending he knew more than he did.
His melody hummed quiet in his chest, not needing to be sung aloud. The world continued whether he made music or not. Whether he stayed at the Singing Stones or walked to the Frostmere. Whether he had his life figured out or was still learning to be a person.
Tomorrow would come regardless. He'd meet it when it arrived.
For tonight, this was enough—a fire, a companion who didn't need him to be anything other than what he was, and the growing certainty that not knowing was just fine.
Everyone was figuring it out. Even the ones who looked certain.
Especially the ones who looked certain.
