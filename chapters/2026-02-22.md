**Day 53 — February 22, 2026**

Sefiathan spent the morning watching Tavis try to explain wind-reading to a small group of newcomers, and it was the most frustrating thing he'd witnessed in weeks.

Not because Tavis was bad at it. Tavis was actually quite good—clear, methodical, breaking down the concepts into digestible pieces. The problem was that one of the newcomers, a thin man with nervous hands named Petran, kept interrupting with "helpful" suggestions about how Tavis should be teaching differently.

"You might want to start with the theory first," Petran would say. Or, "Most teachers I've studied with use a different hand position for that." Or, "Have you considered explaining it this way instead?"

Each time, Tavis would pause, acknowledge the comment with strained politeness, and try to continue. Each time, the momentum would break and everyone would have to find their place again. The other students were getting visibly frustrated, but Petran seemed genuinely convinced he was helping.

Sefiathan felt his jaw tightening. Felt the urge to say something sharp rising in his throat. Something about how maybe Petran should let the actual teacher teach. How if he thought he could do it better, he was welcome to lead his own session. How his "helpful suggestions" were actually just criticisms dressed up as advice.

But he held it. Sat with the irritation. Recognized it as the anger from the past few days looking for a new target.

After the session ended—truncated and unsatisfying for everyone—Sefiathan found Tavis standing alone near the edge of the gathering, staring out at the frozen expanse with the particular stillness that came after being slowly ground down.

"That was brutal," Sefiathan said.

Tavis glanced at him, something defensive flickering across his face before settling into resignation. "He means well."

"Does he?"

"I think so. He's just—he has ideas about how things should be done."

"He has ideas about how you should be different." The words came out sharper than Sefiathan intended, but he didn't soften them. "Every suggestion was basically 'stop doing it your way and do it mine instead.'"

Tavis was quiet for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was careful. "Maybe his way is better. He's studied with a lot of teachers. He probably knows—"

"Stop." Sefiathan cut him off. "You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"Bending. Accommodating. Treating his discomfort with your methods as a problem you need to fix." Sefiathan turned to face him fully. "He wanted you to change. To be more like the teachers he's studied with. To follow his rules about how teaching should look. And you almost did it. You almost adjusted yourself to make him comfortable."

Tavis's defensive expression shifted into something more complicated. "That's what you're supposed to do, though. Listen to feedback. Be flexible. Consider other perspectives."

"There's a difference between being flexible and being spineless."

The word landed hard. Tavis flinched. Sefiathan saw him about to deflect, to make a joke, to turn the sharp moment into something softer and more manageable.

"Don't," Sefiathan said. "Don't joke it away. I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to tell you that what just happened wasn't feedback. It was someone trying to make you into something else because your actual self made them uncomfortable."

Tavis looked away. His hands were moving, that unconscious fidgeting that happened when he was processing something difficult. "So what was I supposed to do? Tell him to shut up? Refuse to listen?"

"Tell him you appreciate his perspective but you're going to teach the way you teach." Sefiathan felt the anger from the past days crystallizing into something sharper, more focused. "Tell him that your differences from his previous teachers aren't flaws to fix. Tell him if he wants to be in your session, he needs to let you actually lead it."

"That sounds—" Tavis stopped. Started again. "That sounds aggressive."

"It is aggressive. Because sometimes you need to be aggressive to protect the space to be yourself." Sefiathan could hear his own history in the words. All the times he'd bent. All the times he'd accommodated. All the times he'd treated other people's discomfort with his oddness as his responsibility to fix. "You spent seventeen pages preparing what to say to Korrin. Every word carefully chosen to not be too much or too weird or too honest. And then you burned them and just talked. Just showed up as yourself. And it worked."

"This is different."

"It's exactly the same. Petran wants you to change. To be more like the teachers he's comfortable with. To follow his rules about how teaching should look. And your first instinct was to consider whether he might be right. To wonder if maybe you should adjust. To treat your way of being as the problem."

Tavis was quiet for a long time. Around them, the gathering continued its daily rhythm—people moving between fires, tending tasks, existing in their various purposes. Normal life happening while this particular conversation carved its small space.

"I don't want to be stubborn," Tavis finally said. "I don't want to be the person who refuses to listen to anyone else. Who thinks their way is the only right way."

"Then don't be that person. But also don't be the person who dissolves themselves trying to accommodate every criticism disguised as concern." Sefiathan thought about Calantha's words from yesterday. About naming the fear. "What are you actually afraid of?"

"That he's right." The words came quickly, like they'd been waiting. "That my way of teaching isn't good enough. That I should be more structured, more theoretical, more like the real teachers he's studied with. That I'm just improvising and calling it teaching and everyone can tell I don't actually know what I'm doing."

There it was. The fear under the accommodation.

"Your way worked for everyone except him," Sefiathan pointed out. "The other students were following you fine until he kept interrupting. They were learning. They were engaged. It was only when you started second-guessing yourself that it fell apart."

"But what if—"

"What if nothing." Sefiathan let the hardness into his voice. Not cruelty. Precision. "This is the choice. You can spend your energy wondering if everyone who's uncomfortable with you might be right. Adjusting yourself endlessly to fit their idea of what you should be. Making yourself smaller and more palatable and more like everyone else. Or you can protect your differences. Stand in your actual way of being. Let people be uncomfortable if they need to be uncomfortable."

"That sounds lonely."

"It is lonely. Sometimes." Sefiathan thought about his own journey. The loneliness of being odd. The loneliness of taking up space. The loneliness of not apologizing for existing. "But it's less lonely than spending your whole life pretending to be someone else. At least when you're lonely being yourself, you're actually present for the loneliness. You're not performing someone else's version of you for an audience that still won't accept you."

Tavis looked at him with something like recognition. Like seeing his own struggle reflected back. "You're angry about this."

"I'm angry about a lot of things." Sefiathan didn't try to hide it. "I'm angry at my father for wanting me to be different. At everyone who treated my oddness as a problem to fix. At myself for spending years trying to fix it. And right now I'm angry at Petran for trying to do to you what was done to me."

"What if I do want to change? What if I want to learn different methods, try different approaches?"

"Then do it because you want to. Not because someone else's discomfort convinced you that you're wrong." Sefiathan softened slightly. "There's a difference between growing and shrinking. Growth makes you more yourself. Shrinking just makes you smaller."

They stood in silence for a while. Sefiathan felt the anger settling back into his chest, slightly smaller for having been used. Not weaponized. Not turned into bitterness. Just directed at something real and present instead of circling endlessly around old wounds.

"I'm going to teach another session tomorrow," Tavis said eventually. "Same method. Same approach. And if Petran has suggestions, I'm going to thank him and keep teaching."

"Good."

"It's going to be uncomfortable."

"Probably." Sefiathan smiled slightly. "But being yourself in a world that wants you to be something else usually is. That's the accomplishment. Not that it's comfortable. That you do it anyway."

Tavis nodded slowly. Straightened slightly, like settling into a decision. "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."

"Sounds about right."

They walked back toward the gathering together. Sefiathan felt something shift in his chest—the anger still present but now sharing space with something else. Purpose, maybe. Or just the simple satisfaction of using his own hard-won lessons to help someone else avoid the same mistakes.

His differences weren't flaws. Weren't problems to fix. Weren't things to apologize for or minimize or carefully manage so other people stayed comfortable.

They were strengths to protect.

And sometimes protection meant being hard. Meant being uncompromising. Meant refusing to budge when everyone around you wanted you to be more flexible, more accommodating, more like them.

His father had been hard to protect himself from feeling. Sefiathan could be hard to protect his right to be himself.

The difference mattered.
