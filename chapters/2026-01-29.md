Day 29 - January 29, 2026
The sadness arrived without announcement in the middle of the morning.
They'd been walking through dense pine forest, following a path that wound between trees so old their trunks were wider than Sefiathan could stretch his arms. The light came green-filtered through needles overhead, and everything smelled of resin and earth. Beautiful, objectively. The kind of forest that should inspire awe.
But Sefiathan felt heavy. Sad in a way that had no clear source, no identifiable cause. Just—sad.
He tried to shake it off at first. Told himself he was fine, that there was no reason to feel this way, that he should appreciate where he was. But the sadness remained, patient and pervasive, like fog that wouldn't burn off.
"You alright?" Korrin asked after they'd been walking in silence for an hour.
"I don't know," Sefiathan admitted. "I feel—sad. But I don't know why."
Korrin slowed their pace slightly. "Does it need a why?"
The question caught him off guard. He'd been trying to identify the source—something Korrin had said yesterday? Missing home? Worry about the journey? His brain was cataloging possibilities, building cases, trying to solve the sadness by finding its origin.
"I usually need to know why I feel things," Sefiathan said. "So I can fix it."
"Mm." Korrin adjusted their pack. "The wind-readers would say you're trying to solve a constellation when you should just be looking at it."
"What does that mean?"
"You ever look at stars and try to figure out which one is making you sad?" Korrin gestured vaguely upward, though no stars were visible through the pine canopy. "You can't. Because it's not one star. It's the whole pattern. The way they arrange themselves in the dark. You're a constellation of sadness right now—lots of small things making one big feeling. Trying to solve which star is the problem misses the point."
Sefiathan walked in silence, testing that idea. The sadness wasn't about one thing. It was about—everything? Nothing? His family and leaving home and being almost a month into this journey without knowing if he was any different than when he started. The way Korrin's cousin haunted yesterday's conversation. The memory of the Singing Stones and how peaceful that had been. Missing Thessaly somehow, even though he'd only met her once. The question of whether he'd ever go home. Whether home would still be there when he did.
All of it. None of it. A constellation.
"So what do I do with it?" he asked.
"Feel it completely. Watch it move. Notice what else exists alongside it."
They stopped for a rest near a stream that cut through the forest floor. The water was clear and cold, running over smooth stones worn round by time. Sefiathan sat on a fallen log and let the sadness be there without trying to fix it, solve it, or understand it.
It felt enormous. Like it was the only thing in the sky, the only constellation visible. His pain felt like the entire universe—vast and all-encompassing and permanent.
But then—slowly—he started noticing other things.
The sound of water moving over stones. Not happy or sad, just—moving.
The way light caught on Korrin's silver-threaded hair as they refilled their waterskin.
A small bird hopping along the stream bank, dunking its head in the water, then shaking itself dry.
The solid weight of the log beneath him, real and present.
His sadness was there—vast and heavy and real. But so were these other things. The sadness wasn't the whole sky. It was a constellation among constellations. Bright and dominant right now, but not alone.
"I think I've been treating sadness like it's a problem to solve," Sefiathan said. "Like if I'm sad, something's wrong and I need to fix it."
"Is something wrong?"
"I don't know. Maybe nothing's wrong. Maybe I'm just—sad." He watched the bird continue its bathing ritual. "Maybe that's allowed."
"It's definitely allowed." Korrin sat beside him on the log. "Sadness isn't malfunction. It's just weather. It moves through if you let it. Gets stuck if you try to trap it or solve it or deny it permission to be there."
They resumed walking after a while. The sadness came too, but Sefiathan noticed it felt different when he wasn't fighting it. Heavier in some ways—he had to actually feel it instead of trying to think his way around it. But lighter too, because he wasn't carrying the additional weight of it being wrong to feel this way.
By afternoon, the forest began to thin. They emerged from the dense pines into more open hill country where the trees scattered into groves and meadow grass grew between them. The sky opened up—actual sky, vast and blue with high clouds moving slowly across it.
And Sefiathan, looking up at that enormous sky, realized his sadness was smaller than he'd thought. Not gone—still there, still real. But not the whole sky. Just a pattern within it. One constellation among many.
He felt sad about leaving home without resolution. That was true.
He also felt grateful for Korrin's steady presence. That was also true.
He felt uncertain about where this journey was taking him. True.
He felt curious about the wind-readers at the Frostmere. Also true.
He felt lonely for his sister. True.
He felt content in his solitude. True.
All of it—constellation of sadness, constellation of gratitude, constellation of uncertainty, constellation of peace. All there at once in the vast sky of his experience.
That evening they made camp in a meadow where they could see the sun set over distant mountains. The peaks were still far off but visible now—the Thornspire Mountains that marked the northern edge of known territory. Beyond them, somewhere, lay the Frostmere.
As darkness fell and actual stars appeared, Sefiathan lay on his back looking up at the real constellations. Korrin lay nearby, both of them quiet, watching light that had traveled impossible distances to reach their eyes.
"I'm still sad," Sefiathan said into the darkness.
"Yeah," Korrin replied. "Me too, actually."
"About your cousin?"
"Among other things." Korrin shifted slightly. "I'm sad about leaving my herd. About being in-between—not fully herd anymore, but not fully independent either. About not knowing if I made the right choice." They paused. "Constellation of sadness. But also—constellation of freedom. Constellation of possibility. All there at once."
Sefiathan thought about that. How you could be sad and grateful simultaneously. Lonely and content. Lost and exactly where you needed to be.
"I think I've been trying to solve my sadness by making myself not-sad," he said. "Like the goal is to feel only good things. Only peace and confidence and clarity."
"That sounds exhausting."
"It is." Sefiathan watched a star that might have been a planet—brighter than the others, steady instead of twinkling. "What if I just—let myself be a constellation of everything? Sad and grateful and uncertain and peaceful?"
"Then you'd be human." Korrin's voice held a smile. "Which is what you are."
The stars wheeled overhead in their ancient patterns. The constellations people had been naming and renaming for thousands of years, trying to make sense of light in darkness. And down here, on the ground, Sefiathan was his own constellation—a pattern of feelings that didn't need solving, just—existing. Moving. Being witnessed.
His melody came to him as he lay under stars, and tonight it was minor-key but not sad exactly. More like—bittersweet. The sound of multiple truths existing at once. Sadness and beauty. Loneliness and connection. Loss and discovery.
The whole sky of being alive.
Tomorrow the sadness might still be there. Probably would be. But tomorrow he'd also notice the other constellations—the gratitude and wonder and simple animal pleasure of being alive in a body that worked, under a sky that continued being vast and full of light.
For tonight, he was sad. And grateful. And uncertain. And at peace.
A constellation of everything human.
And that was enough.
