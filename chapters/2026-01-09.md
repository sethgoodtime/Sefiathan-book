Day 9: The One Who Shows Up

The knee held.

Sefiathan tested it cautiously in the morning—standing, then walking a few steps, then a wider circle around his camp. The swelling had gone down significantly. There was still a dull ache when he bent it fully, but nothing like the sharp rebellion of two days ago. His body had forgiven him, at least partially, for years of neglect.

He packed up his camp with care, thanking the oak tree aloud (which felt slightly ridiculous but also right), and continued north. The forest here was beginning to shift in character. The trees were still massive, still ancient, but the understory was thicker—more ferns, more flowering plants, occasional clearings where light created pockets of warmth and growth.

It was in one of these clearings that he found the campsite.

Not an active camp—no fire, no people. But clear evidence that someone had been here recently. A ring of stones arranged for a fire pit. Flattened areas where tents had been. And, most intriguingly, a small cairn of stones with what looked like an offering placed on top: a woven bracelet of dried flowers, already crumbling with age, and a small carved wooden bird.

Sefiathan approached slowly, as if the campsite might vanish if he moved too quickly. He crouched near the cairn, studying the bird. It was crude work—clearly carved by hand, knife marks visible, proportions slightly off. But there was something charming about its awkwardness. It looked a bit like his ugly bird from the first day. All wrong but singing anyway.

He picked it up, turned it over in his hands. On the underside, carved in small letters: *For the traveler who comes next. May you find what you're looking for. - K*

Sefiathan felt something catch in his chest.

Someone had been here. Had made camp, had carved this bird, had left it specifically for whoever came after. They'd had no way of knowing if anyone would find it, if the offering would mean anything, if the traveler who came next would even notice.

But they'd left it anyway.

*The person showing up consistently deserves more than your suspicion.*

The Co-Star reading had warned him about this—his tendency to catalog reasons why things wouldn't work, why people couldn't be trusted, why his careful nature was keeping him safe when really it was keeping him stuck.

Sefiathan had spent most of his life suspicious of kindness. When his mother made his favorite meals, he wondered what she wanted from him. When his father patiently corrected his carpentry mistakes, he assumed it was disappointment disguised as teaching. When Torval paid for his camping fee, when Mikken offered to share his tent, when Lyrei gave him the piece of glass—he'd accepted these gifts but always with a question mark attached. *Why are they doing this? What do they want? What's the catch?*

It was exhausting, cataloging reasons why love might be conditional, why kindness might be manipulation, why showing up for someone might be a trap.

But here was evidence of someone who had simply—shown up. Not for anyone specific. Not expecting anything in return. Just leaving something small and kind for whoever came next, because that's what you did when you walked through the world trying to make it slightly better than you found it.

Sefiathan sat down heavily next to the cairn, still holding the wooden bird.

His mother had shown up consistently for twenty-seven years. Made meals, tended her garden, taught him about plants even when it became clear he wouldn't inherit her magic. She'd never asked for gratitude, never thrown her efforts in his face when he failed to manifest abilities. She'd just—been there. Consistently. Day after day.

His father had shown up at the workshop every morning, teaching him the same cuts and joins over and over, adjusting his grip on tools, never losing patience even when Sefiathan broke a fifth piece of wood trying to master a simple mortise. He'd shown up not because Sefiathan was good at carpentry, but because he was his son, and teaching him was what fathers did.

Torval had paid for his camping fee without being asked. Mikken had offered his tent without expecting anything back. Lyrei had given him a piece of her orb and told him truths that were uncomfortable but necessary.

And he'd met all of this consistent showing-up with suspicion. With the assumption that there must be a catch, that people who kept appearing in his life with kindness must want something he couldn't give, that eventually they'd grow tired of his inadequacy and leave.

But what if they were just—showing up? Because that's what you did for people you cared about?

What if his careful nature wasn't protecting him at all, but was actually keeping him from receiving the love that had been offered consistently his entire life?

Sefiathan placed the wooden bird carefully back on the cairn. Then he pulled off Mikken's handkerchief—the ridiculous one with the dancing chicken—folded it carefully, and placed it next to the bird.

For the next traveler. For whoever came after him and needed to know that someone had thought of them, had left something small and kind, had shown up in the only way possible for a person you'd never meet.

He added a small piece of quartz he'd found near the stream, pretty in the way rocks sometimes are when light hits them right. And one of the few remaining pieces of dried meat from Torval's gift, wrapped carefully in a leaf.

Not much. But something. Evidence that he'd been here, that he'd understood the gift of the wooden bird, that he was learning to show up in small ways.

Sefiathan stood, shouldering his pack. His knee twinged but held. He touched the cairn once more in farewell and continued north.

As he walked, he thought about all the people who'd shown up consistently in his life. His mother's garden, always tended. His father's workshop, always open. His sister managing the accounts, keeping the family solvent, never complaining about being the competent one. The way Raskell had let him camp, asking only the standard fee, no questions about why he was alone or where he was going.

The world was full of people showing up. And he'd spent twenty-seven years cataloging reasons to be suspicious of that showing up instead of simply receiving it.

The forest opened into another clearing, this one larger, with a small stream running through it. Sefiathan stopped to refill his waterskin and noticed something: a plant growing near the water that he recognized from his mother's garden. Moonbright, she'd called it. Good for tea, soothing for anxiety, helped with sleep.

His mother had shown up in his memory, offering knowledge even though she wasn't physically here.

Sefiathan carefully harvested some of the moonbright leaves, the way she'd taught him—never taking more than a third of the plant, always leaving enough for it to recover, always thanking it for what it gave. He dried the leaves in the sun while he rested, then packed them carefully away.

That night, he made camp near a massive cedar whose roots created a natural shelter. He built a fire—properly, using the techniques his father had taught him, the same patient methodology that applied to carpentry. Take your time. Pay attention to what the wood is telling you. Don't force it.

The fire caught easily. His father had shown up in his hands, in the knowledge he'd absorbed despite thinking he'd failed to learn anything useful.

Sefiathan made tea with the moonbright leaves, drinking it slowly, tasting his mother's care in every sip. He thought about the wooden bird, about the person called K who had carved it and left it for a stranger. About Torval and Mikken and Lyrei, who'd shown up for three days and changed something fundamental in how he saw himself.

About all the ways people had been showing up in his life, consistently, asking nothing in return except maybe that he notice. That he receive the gift without suspicion. That he trust that love could be offered simply, without conditions, without catches.

He pulled out his journal and wrote:

*Day 9: Found evidence that other people exist in the world and sometimes they're kind for no reason. This shouldn't be revelatory but apparently I've been treating all kindness like a trap. Turns out my "careful nature" was just fear wearing a sophisticated costume.*

*Left an offering for whoever comes next. Felt like praying to a god I don't have a name for yet. The god of showing up consistently. The god of small kindnesses. The god of loving people you'll never meet by leaving them something to find.*

*My mother showed up in moonbright leaves. My father showed up in fire-building. Torval and Mikken and Lyrei showed up in memories that keep teaching me things. Even K, whoever they are, showed up in a wooden bird carved by someone I'll never meet.*

*Maybe love is just this: showing up consistently, in whatever small ways you can, trusting that it matters even when you can't see the results.*

He closed the journal and sat by the fire, drinking tea, watching flames dance in patterns his father had taught him to read for heat distribution and wood quality. The forest around him was full of presences—not ghosts, but the accumulated showing-up of everything that lived here. Trees that had stood for centuries. Animals that walked these paths daily. Fungi breaking down fallen logs into soil. Water carving channels through stone. All of it showing up, consistently, making the forest what it was through sheer persistence.

Sefiathan's melody came to him, and tonight it had a new phrase. Still incomplete, still searching, but with a thread running through it now—something about gratitude, about receiving gifts without suspicion, about trusting that the world was full of small kindnesses if you stopped cataloging reasons to doubt them.

He fell asleep by the fire, warm and fed and thinking about wooden birds carved by strangers who believed in showing up for people they'd never meet.

It felt like a kind of love.

Maybe it felt like the beginning of understanding what love was.
