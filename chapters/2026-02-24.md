**Day 55 — February 24, 2026**

Sefiathan woke with words lodged in his throat. Not the careful, diplomatic ones he'd spent his life crafting. The raw ones. The true ones. The ones that had been building pressure for days now, maybe years, pressing against the back of his teeth like prisoners demanding release.

He lay in his tent listening to the gathering come alive around him—voices, footsteps, the crackle of morning fires—and felt the tension coiled in his chest like a spring wound too tight. The anger had been useful yesterday, had helped him draw clear lines with Petran. But this was something different. This was everything he'd never said to the people who actually needed to hear it.

His father's voice in his head: "You're too sensitive. Always making everything complicated."

His mother, gentle and distant: "Why can't you just be content with what you have?"

Mira, fitting so perfectly into the space he'd failed to fill: "Your father just wants what's best for you."

All the careful words he'd used to avoid conflict. To keep peace. To make sure no one was uncomfortable with his pain. "I understand." "It's fine." "Maybe you're right." "I'm probably just overreacting."

Sefiathan sat up. The tension wasn't going away. Wasn't dissolving through understanding or meditation or careful breathing. It was there, solid and demanding, and maybe it was time to stop treating that as a problem.

He found Korrin near the edge of the gathering, methodically grooming his flanks with the focused attention he brought to most physical tasks. The centaur glanced up as Sefiathan approached, read something in his face, and straightened.

"You look like you're about to do something stupid," Korrin observed.

"Maybe." Sefiathan's voice came out rougher than he intended. "I need to say something. And I need you to just let me say it without trying to fix it or soften it or tell me there are better ways to think about it."

Korrin studied him for a long moment, then nodded once. "Alright."

Sefiathan took a breath. The words wanted out so badly they almost hurt. "I'm angry at my father for never seeing me. For deciding I was disappointing before I even had a chance to be anything else. For treating my differences like character flaws instead of just—" He stopped. Started again. "Instead of just who I am. I'm angry that he made me feel like I had to apologize for existing. Like taking up space was presumptuous. Like wanting things was selfish."

The words were coming faster now, less controlled. "And I'm angry at my mother for being so gentle with everything except me. For tending her plants with more care than she ever showed her son. For always being just out of reach, like there was a version of me she could love but I never quite managed to become it."

Korrin said nothing. Just stood there, solid and present, letting Sefiathan fill the space between them with everything he'd been holding back.

"And I'm angry at Mira for fitting so perfectly into the space I was supposed to fill. For being what they wanted without even trying. For making it look so easy when it was so hard for me. I know that's not her fault. I know she didn't do anything wrong. But I'm angry anyway because watching her succeed at being the child my father wanted felt like watching proof that the problem was me."

The spring in his chest was unwinding now, painful but necessary. "I'm angry at everyone who ever told me I was too sensitive. Too complicated. Too much. At everyone who treated my pain like a performance they had to endure instead of something real. At everyone who said they wanted honesty but only if it was the gentle, palatable kind that didn't make them uncomfortable."

He was breathing hard now, like he'd been running. The words kept coming, rawer and less filtered. "And I'm angry at myself for swallowing it all. For spending years trying to be smaller, easier, less trouble. For apologizing every time I took up space. For treating my own needs like optional luxuries instead of requirements for survival. For believing them when they said the problem was me."

Sefiathan stopped. The silence that followed felt enormous. He'd never said any of this out loud before. Had barely let himself think it directly. Had spent his whole life carefully managing these feelings, keeping them contained and controlled and safely unexpressed.

Now they were out there. Raw and harsh and unfiltered. And he couldn't take them back.

"Are you done?" Korrin asked quietly.

"I don't know." Sefiathan felt shaky, exposed. Like he'd just stripped naked in public. "Maybe."

"Good." Korrin's voice was level, neither approving nor disapproving. Just present. "That needed to come out."

"I sound like a child."

"You sound like someone who's been holding back for too long." Korrin shifted his weight, considering. "The careful words weren't working because they weren't true. They were performance. Protection. Ways of saying something without actually saying it."

Sefiathan nodded. Felt the truth of that settle into his chest where the tension had been. The careful words had been armor. Had been ways of expressing pain without risking conflict. Of showing hurt without demanding that anyone actually change.

"What if I said all that to them?" The question came out smaller than he intended. "To my father. My mother. Mira. What if I just—screamed it at them the way I just screamed it at you?"

"They'd probably be uncomfortable."

"That's what I'm afraid of."

"No." Korrin shook his head. "That's what you're supposed to be afraid of. The real fear is that you'd say all that and they still wouldn't understand. Still wouldn't change. Still wouldn't give you what you need. You'd stop protecting them from your real feelings and discover it didn't fix anything."

The words hit like a punch to the sternum. That was the fear. Not that he'd make them uncomfortable. That he'd finally be completely honest and it wouldn't matter. They'd hear all of it—every raw, unfiltered word—and still somehow make it his fault for saying it wrong.

"So what do I do with it?" Sefiathan's voice cracked slightly. "If saying it to them won't fix anything, what's the point?"

"The point isn't fixing them." Korrin's tone was matter-of-fact. "The point is stopping the protection. You've been carefully managing your words to avoid conflict. To keep everyone comfortable. To make sure your hurt doesn't inconvenience anyone. That's what's been building the pressure. Not the feelings themselves. The constant work of making them palatable."

Sefiathan thought about that. About all the times he'd taken a true feeling and translated it into something softer. Something easier to hear. Something that wouldn't upset anyone or cause problems or make him seem unreasonable.

"The careful words weren't working because they weren't true," he said slowly, echoing Korrin's earlier statement.

"Right. You can't resolve something you're not actually expressing. You've been presenting edited versions of your feelings and wondering why nothing changes. But edited versions don't demand change. They just signal that you've already managed the problem yourself."

The spring in Sefiathan's chest had fully unwound now, leaving something raw and tender in its place. Not peace exactly. But the absence of that crushing pressure. The absence of words trying to claw their way out.

"I don't know if I can say all that to them," he admitted. "The real version. The unedited one."

"Maybe you can't yet." Korrin's expression softened slightly. "But you said it out loud. You stopped protecting them from how you actually feel. That's the first move. Everything else follows from there."

Sefiathan nodded. Felt exhausted suddenly, like the outburst had drained something essential from him. But also lighter. The tension that had been building for days—for years—had finally found release.

The careful words hadn't been working because they were lies dressed up as diplomacy. They were ways of expressing pain without risk. Of showing hurt without demanding anything change. Of performing honesty while still keeping the real truth safely contained.

And maybe that was the lesson. Not that he needed to scream at his family. But that he needed to stop carefully managing his own feelings to make them easier for everyone else to handle. Needed to let the raw truth exist—first just in his own awareness, then maybe eventually in the world—without immediately rushing to soften it, contextualize it, apologize for it.

The words were out now. Unfiltered and harsh and completely true.

And the world hadn't ended.

That was something.
