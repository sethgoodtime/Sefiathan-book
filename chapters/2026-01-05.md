Day 5: The Parting

Morning came too early, announced by roosters and the sounds of village life beginning. Sefiathan woke to discover that Mikken had indeed kicked him twice in the night and was currently sprawled across three-quarters of the tent space, one arm thrown dramatically across his face.

Sefiathan extracted himself carefully and emerged into cool dawn air. The fire from last night was dead ashes. Torval was already up, repacking his gear with methodical efficiency. Lyrei sat cross-legged near her bedroll, that glass orb in her hands again, watching light play through it as the sun crested the horizon.

"Morning," Sefiathan said, his voice rough with sleep.

"Morning," Torval replied without looking up. "There's water in the bucket by the fire ring if you want to wash. We're leaving in an hour."

An hour. Then they'd part ways, and Sefiathan would be alone again, walking into the Wildlands with no clear destination and even less of a plan than when he'd started.

He used the water to wash his face and hands, the cold shocking him fully awake. His reflection in the bucket's surface looked rough—three days of travel had left him even more disheveled than usual. He tried to smooth his hair, gave up, accepted that this was what he looked like now.

By the time he'd packed his meager belongings, Mikken had emerged from the tent, looking surprisingly chipper for someone who snored like a dying animal.

"Last morning together!" Mikken announced. "This calls for a proper goodbye. I've been working on a farewell routine—three objects juggled while reciting an epic poem about the transient nature of companionship. Want to see?"

"No," Torval and Lyrei said simultaneously.

"You're all philistines," Mikken said cheerfully, but he didn't push it.

They shared a sparse breakfast—the last of the bread, some dried fruit from Torval's pack, water from the well. It felt strangely formal, this last meal together. Sefiathan wanted to say something meaningful, to express gratitude for these few days of company, but couldn't find words that didn't sound trite.

Lyrei solved the problem by standing and addressing him directly. "Sefiathan Murrgood. You're going to keep walking north into the Wildlands. You're going to doubt yourself frequently. You're going to compare your progress to imaginary standards and find yourself lacking. You're going to want to quit or turn back or decide this whole journey was a mistake."

"That's... not very encouraging," Sefiathan said.

"I'm not finished. You're also going to notice things others miss because you're paying attention. You're going to help people because that's your nature. You're going to slowly, almost invisibly, become someone who knows how to walk alone. And one day—maybe not this month, maybe not for several months—you're going to realize you're humming a melody, and it won't be incomplete anymore."

She pulled something from her pocket—a small piece of glass, no bigger than a copper coin, threaded on a leather cord. "This is from my orb. A piece that broke off months ago. It doesn't show possibilities anymore, but it catches light beautifully. Wear it. When you doubt yourself, hold it up and remember that there are always more stories available than the one you're telling yourself."

Sefiathan accepted the gift, stunned. The glass felt warm in his palm, and when he held it up, it fractured the morning light into dozens of tiny rainbows.

"I don't know what to say."

"'Thank you' works fine."

"Thank you."

Mikken produced a handkerchief from his apparently infinite supply of random fabric. "I was going to give you one of my juggling stones, but that seemed presumptuous—assuming you'd want to learn to juggle. So instead, take this. It's completely impractical, but sometimes impractical things remind us to not take life too seriously."

The handkerchief was embroidered with what appeared to be a dancing chicken. It was ridiculous. Sefiathan loved it.

"Thank you, Mikken."

Even Torval stepped forward, somewhat awkwardly, and handed Sefiathan a small wrapped package. "Dried meat. Enough for three days if you're careful. And a better waterskin than that sad excuse you've been carrying."

The gruff practicality of it was somehow more touching than any flowery gesture could have been.

"Thank you. All of you. I know I was... I know you didn't have to include me. Or help me. Or teach me anything. But you did, and it matters."

"You're welcome," Lyrei said simply. "Now go. The day's wasting, and we all have paths to walk."

They parted at the northern edge of Raskell, where the village road gave way to a rougher trail that led into denser forest. Torval, Mikken, and Lyrei turned northeast, following some lead or intuition Sefiathan didn't understand. He continued due north, toward the place the signpost had called the Wildlands.

He walked for perhaps ten minutes before stopping to look back. He could still see them in the distance—three figures growing smaller, heading toward their mysterious goal.

Then he turned north again and walked on.

The forest here was different than near Millhaven. The trees grew closer together, their branches creating a canopy that filtered sunlight into green-gold dimness. The path was less defined, requiring more attention to follow. Sefiathan found himself testing each step, learning to read the subtle signs of where others had walked before.

He was alone again.

But he didn't feel abandoned. He felt... released. Like he'd been given permission to stumble, to be uncertain, to walk his own strange path without apology.

Sefiathan pulled out the piece of glass Lyrei had given him and held it up to catch the light. Rainbows danced across his palm, dozens of different colors from a single source.

Multiple stories. Both/and instead of either/or.

He was both lost and finding his way. Both incompetent and learning. Both alone and carrying the gifts of companions who'd shared his road for a brief time.

Maybe that was the point. Maybe you didn't have to choose one story. Maybe you could hold several contradictions at once and call it growth.

Sefiathan began to hum as he walked. The melody was still incomplete, still searching for itself. But today it felt a little less desperate, a little more curious.

He thought of the ugly bird, singing its way toward flight.

He thought of Lyrei's words: *You're going to slowly, almost invisibly, become someone who knows how to walk alone.*

He thought of Torval's blunt honesty: *The first week is always terrible.*

He thought of Mikken's cheerful absurdity: *To spectacular failures that make excellent stories later!*

And he walked.

North into the Wildlands, into whatever the year would bring, carrying dried meat and a better waterskin and a piece of glass that caught the light and a handkerchief embroidered with a dancing chicken.

It wasn't much. But it was more than he'd had five days ago.

And today, that felt like enough.

The path ahead curved deeper into the forest, and Sefiathan followed it, humming his incomplete melody, ready for whatever Day Six would bring.
