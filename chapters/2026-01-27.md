Day 27 - January 27, 2026
They walked through morning mist that clung to the low places between hills. Korrin moved with steady certainty while Sefiathan found himself cataloging the reasons this might be a mistake.
Walking to the Frostmere without a clear purpose. Following someone he'd just met. Committing nine days to a destination he knew nothing about. The voice in his head was building its case with the careful precision of a prosecution: You're being impulsive. You don't know Korrin. What if the gathering isn't what you need? What if you're wasting time that could be spent—
Sefiathan stopped walking.
Korrin continued a few paces before noticing, then turned back. "Need a rest?"
"No, I—" Sefiathan looked at his feet, at the path ahead, at the mist beginning to burn off in morning sun. "I'm building a case."
"Against?"
"This. Going to the Frostmere. Following you. All of it." He said it plainly, without apology. "My brain is listing every reason this is wrong."
Korrin nodded slowly, like this made perfect sense. "What's the case say?"
"That I don't know what I'm doing. That I'm making decisions without enough information. That I should have a better reason for going somewhere than just—going." The words tumbled out, and hearing them aloud made them sound both reasonable and ridiculous.
"Mm." Korrin shifted their pack. "And what are you really feeling under all that?"
The question landed different than expected. Not what are you thinking but what are you feeling.
Sefiathan stood with it. Underneath the elaborate case his brain was constructing—the logical arguments about prudence and planning and making good choices—what was actually there?
"Hurt," he said quietly. The admission surprised him. "I'm hurt that I left home angry. That things with my family weren't resolved. That I've been gone almost a month and haven't sent word." He paused. "And I'm hurt that I'm still not ready to go back."
"So the case against traveling to the Frostmere..."
"Is really about not wanting to feel hurt about home." Sefiathan looked up at Korrin. "I'm building reasons why this is wrong so I don't have to admit someone got to me."
"Your family got to you."
"Yeah." The word came out rough. "My father never thought I'd amount to much. My sister was always better at everything practical. My mother loved me but in that—that disappointed way. Like she could see who I was supposed to be and knew I wasn't becoming it." He kicked at a loose stone. "And they were probably right. I left because I couldn't stand being the failed version of their expectations anymore."
Korrin sat down right there in the middle of the path, settling onto the ground with their legs folded in that way centaurs managed. "Come here."
Sefiathan hesitated, then sat facing them.
"Someone disappointed you," Korrin said. "Hurt you. Made you feel like you weren't enough. And you can spend the next nine days—or nine years—building elaborate cases about why you shouldn't do things, shouldn't go places, shouldn't try. Or you can just feel the sting and own it."
"Own it how?"
"By saying: my family hurt me. I'm hurt about it. That's true." Korrin's voice was matter-of-fact, not sympathetic exactly, but not dismissive either. "Not building a case about whether they meant to hurt you, or whether you deserved it, or whether you're being too sensitive. Just—they hurt you. You're hurt. That happened."
Sefiathan felt something crack open in his chest. All the elaborate explanations he'd been constructing about why he'd left Millhaven—the quest for purpose, the search for power, the journey of self-discovery. Underneath all of it, simpler and more painful: his family had made him feel worthless, and he'd run.
"I don't want to be someone who runs away from hurt," he said.
"You're not running now. You're walking toward something." Korrin stood, offered a hand to pull Sefiathan up. "But you can't walk toward anything real while you're busy building cases. The case is just a fancy way of not feeling."
They resumed walking, but Sefiathan felt different. Heavier and lighter at once. The hurt sat in his chest now, acknowledged. Not resolved or healed or made better—just real. His father's dismissiveness. His sister's casual competence that made his struggles look like character flaws. His mother's loving disappointment.
They hurt you.
Yes.
Around midday they stopped by a stream to refill water and eat. Korrin gathered wild mint growing near the water, crushed it between their palms, and offered it to Sefiathan to smell.
"My herd has this saying," Korrin said. "You can't talk yourself out of feeling hurt. You can only avoid admitting someone got to you."
"Is that what I've been doing? Avoiding?"
"You've been building cases. Very elaborate ones, I'd guess, knowing how smart you seem." Korrin dropped the mint into their water flask. "Smart people are the best at fooling themselves. They can construct entire philosophies to avoid simple pain."
Sefiathan drank from the stream, the cold water sharp and clean. "So what do I do with it? The hurt?"
"Feel the sting. Own it. Move on." Korrin said it like it was that simple. "Not move past it—that's different. Just move on. Keep walking. The hurt comes along, but it doesn't get to build your itinerary."
They walked through afternoon sun, the path climbing gradually into hillier country. Pine trees appeared more frequently, and the air carried a different quality—cooler, cleaner, with an edge that suggested mountains somewhere ahead.
Sefiathan tested the difference between moving past hurt and moving on with it. Moving past suggested the hurt should disappear, should be resolved, should stop mattering. Moving on meant—what? Carrying it? Letting it be real while also continuing to walk?
"I'm still hurt about home," he said aloud, testing how it felt to just state it plainly.
"Yep."
"And I'm still going to the Frostmere."
"Yep."
"Those things can both be true."
"They are both true." Korrin pointed ahead to where the path split around a large boulder. "Left or right. Both get to the same place eventually."
Sefiathan chose left without building a case for it. The path continued. The hurt continued. Both things, true at once.
By evening they'd reached higher ground where the pines grew thick and the air held genuine cold. Korrin found a campsite in a small clearing, sheltered by trees on three sides. They built a fire together, worked in comfortable silence to prepare a meal.
As darkness settled and the fire pushed back against it, Sefiathan spoke into the quiet. "My father told me I'd never finish anything I started. The day before I left."
"Did he mean it to hurt you?"
"I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe he thought he was being realistic." Sefiathan poked at the fire. "But it hurt anyway."
"Then it hurt." Korrin handed him a bowl of the soup they'd made—root vegetables, dried meat, herbs. "His intention doesn't change your pain. You don't need to build a case proving you had permission to be hurt."
Sefiathan ate the soup slowly, feeling the warmth of it spread through his chest. The hurt was still there—his father's words, his sister's easy success, his mother's loving worry that always felt like disappointment. But naming it plainly, without elaborate justification, made it somehow more bearable.
"I spent weeks building a case about my journey," he said. "Told myself I was seeking my power, finding my purpose, becoming who I was meant to be. And maybe that's true. But also—I was hurt and I ran."
"Both true." Korrin set down their empty bowl. "And now you're here. Still hurt. Still walking. That's honest at least."
The fire crackled. Somewhere in the dark pines, something rustled—a small animal going about its night-business. The stars appeared through gaps in the branches overhead, cold and distant and indifferent to human hurt.
Sefiathan thought about all the elaborate explanations he'd constructed over the years. Every time someone hurt him, he'd built a case—about why it didn't really hurt, or why he deserved it, or why they didn't mean it, or why he was too sensitive. Anything except the simple truth: they hurt you, and you're hurt about it.
"The wind-readers at the Frostmere," he asked. "Do they talk about this kind of thing?"
"They talk about reading wind. But wind is just air moving from hurt places to healing places, trying to balance pressure." Korrin lay back, looking up at stars. "Same as people, really. We're all just trying to balance the pressure of what hurt us."
Sefiathan finished his soup and set the bowl aside. Tomorrow they'd walk again. The hurt would come too. But at least now he wasn't building cases against it, wasn't constructing elaborate philosophies to avoid the simple sting of being disappointed by people he loved.
His family hurt him. He was hurt about it. That was true.
And also true: he was here, walking north with a centaur who spoke plainly about pain, heading toward a gathering of people who admitted they didn't know what they were doing.
Both things. Real at once.
His melody hummed in his chest, and tonight it had a quality of acknowledgment. Not resolution—the hurt didn't resolve just because you named it. But acknowledgment. The simple honesty of saying: this happened, this hurt, I'm hurt about it.
No elaborate case needed. No justification required.
Just the sting, owned plainly.
And the walking, continued anyway.
Sefiathan settled into his bedroll beside the fire, the hurt a real weight in his chest. But lighter somehow for not being dressed up in elaborate explanations. Just hurt. Simple and true.
Tomorrow he'd walk with it. Feel the sting and keep moving.
Not past it. Just on.
