Day 33 - February 2, 2026
Sefiathan woke to find Tavis sitting up, wrapped in blankets, staring at the cave entrance where morning light filtered through diminishing snow. The storm had passed in the night, leaving the world outside muffled and white.
Korrin was already awake, tending the fire they'd kept burning through the night. They looked exhausted—dark circles under their eyes, movements slower than usual. They'd barely slept, watching over Tavis.
"Morning," Sefiathan said quietly.
Tavis turned to look at him. They had Korrin's same silver-threaded hair, but their face was thinner, more angular. Younger, maybe, or just worn differently by life. Their eyes held something guarded.
"You're the one who helped," Tavis said. Not a question.
"We both helped."
"Korrin would have come regardless. You chose to." Tavis pulled the blanket tighter. "Thank you."
Sefiathan started melting snow for morning tea, giving his hands something to do. The routine of making hot water, adding herbs, the familiar rhythm of camp care. Except this wasn't his camp, wasn't his routine. This was improvised survival in a cave with two centaurs he barely knew.
And it felt more real than any carefully planned morning had ever felt.
"What happened to you?" Korrin asked gently. "Out there?"
Tavis was quiet for a long moment. Outside, snow slid off a rock with a soft sound. "I was trying to reach the gathering early. Wanted to get there before you, wanted to—I don't know. Prepare myself. Have time to figure out what to say to you." They laughed, but it was bitter. "Took a shortcut that wasn't on any map. Fell into a ravine, then into a stream. By the time I got out, I was soaked and the storm was coming and I couldn't—I couldn't think clearly. Just kept walking, getting more lost, getting colder."
"You could have died," Korrin said.
"I know."
"Because you were trying to control the situation. Trying to arrive on your terms, with your defenses in place, ready to—what? Win the conversation before it started?"
Tavis's jaw tightened. "I was trying to protect myself."
"By walking into a death trap."
The words hung sharp in the small space. Sefiathan handed around cups of weak tea, the warmth more valuable than the taste. He felt the tension between the cousins, the history that layered every word.
"I'm sorry," Korrin said, softer. "That was harsh. I'm just—you almost died because you couldn't face seeing me unprepared. And I'm trying not to—I'm trying not to be angry about that."
"Well you're doing a terrible job," Tavis muttered.
They sat in uncomfortable silence. Sefiathan drank his tea and tried to be invisible, which was impossible in a space this small. He was trapped in someone else's crisis, someone else's unfinished business.
Finally, Tavis spoke. "I've spent two years thinking about what I'd say to you. Practiced it. Prepared every response to every argument you might make. Built the perfect defense against all your criticisms."
"I'm not here to criticize you."
"Aren't you?" Tavis looked at Korrin directly. "Two years ago you told me I was too sensitive. That I needed to handle things better. That I was making my life harder by—by being the way I am."
"I know. And I was wrong."
The admission seemed to surprise Tavis. They blinked, reset. "What?"
"I was wrong. I was projecting my own struggles onto you. Wanting you to be stronger so I could feel less weak." Korrin set down their cup. "I've had two years to think about it too. And mostly what I've thought is—I owe you an apology. A real one. Not a defensive one where I explain why I said what I said, but a simple one. I hurt you. I'm sorry."
Tavis stared at them. "That's it? That's your whole prepared speech?"
"That's it."
"But I—I have seventeen pages of things I need to say to you. About how you made me feel. About the damage it did. About—" Tavis stopped, looking lost. "I spent two years preparing for a fight and you're just—apologizing?"
"Yeah."
Sefiathan watched this unfold with a strange sense of recognition. He'd done the same thing—prepared elaborate defenses, practiced arguments, built cases against people who weren't even attacking him. Rehearsed confrontations that existed only in his head.
And here was Tavis, faced with the disruption of forgiveness they hadn't prepared for.
"I don't know what to do with that," Tavis admitted. "I had it all planned out. Everything I'd say. Every point I'd make. And you just—you're not fighting."
"No."
"Why not?"
Korrin was quiet for a moment. "Because the fight is already over. I lost it two years ago when I chose criticism over kindness. Nothing you say now will make me more wrong than I already was."
Outside, the morning brightened. The storm was fully past, leaving crystalline snow that caught light and threw it back sharp and clean.
Tavis started crying. Not dramatic sobs, just—tears, silent and overwhelming. Korrin moved closer, and after a moment's hesitation, Tavis leaned into them. The two centaurs sat together, one crying, one holding, and all those prepared speeches dissolving into irrelevance.
Sefiathan quietly packed up the camp around them. Melted more snow for water. Checked their supplies. Gave them space for this moment that neither of them had planned for.
When Tavis finally pulled back, wiping their face, they looked younger. Lighter. "I really did prepare seventeen pages."
"I believe you," Korrin said.
"I was going to destroy you with logic and examples and proof that you'd wronged me."
"I wronged you. You don't need to prove it."
Tavis laughed, still crying a little. "This is not how I thought this would go."
"How do you feel?" Sefiathan asked, surprising himself by speaking.
Both centaurs looked at him. Tavis considered the question. "Disrupted. But—good disrupted? Like when you're suffocating under a heavy blanket and someone finally pulls it off and you can breathe again."
"The routine that was protecting you was actually suffocating you," Sefiathan said, more to himself than to them.
"Yeah." Tavis looked at their prepared speeches—literal papers, somehow still dry in their protected pack. "I thought going over and over what happened, building the perfect case, planning every word—I thought that was keeping me safe. But it was just—keeping me trapped in two years ago."
They pulled out the papers. Seventeen pages of careful preparation, detailed arguments, practiced responses. Held them for a moment, then fed them to the fire. The pages caught quickly, curling and blackening.
"Doesn't that feel like giving up?" Sefiathan asked. "Like they get to wrong you and you just—let it go?"
"No," Tavis said, watching the papers burn. "Feels like I'm letting me go. From the prison of rehearsing. From the routine of being wronged. Korrin already admitted they were wrong. My seventeen pages weren't going to make them more wrong. Just keep me more stuck."
The ashes drifted up the smoke. All that preparation, all those practiced arguments, reduced to nothing.
By midmorning they were ready to leave the cave. Tavis was still weak but could walk, and the snow had stopped falling though it lay thick on the ground. Korrin knew where they were now, roughly, and could navigate to the actual path.
As they emerged into blinding white landscape, Tavis stopped. "Thank you," they said to Sefiathan. "For coming. For not—for not making Korrin choose between safety and crisis."
"Someone needed help," Sefiathan said. "That's all that mattered."
"Still. You chose crisis over routine. That takes something."
They walked slowly through snow, making their way back toward the established path. Sefiathan thought about his own routines—the ones he'd built to feel safe, to feel prepared, to feel protected. His careful plans for each day. His rehearsed responses to imagined criticisms. His practiced defenses against attacks that never came.
All of it keeping him trapped in a carefully constructed world that was slowly suffocating him.
The shake-up he'd feared—dropping his agenda, abandoning his route, scrambling across dangerous terrain—had contained exactly what he needed. The reminder that life happened in the disruption, not the plan. That the crisis taught more than the strategy session. That sometimes you needed someone to pull the suffocating blanket off so you could breathe again.
By afternoon they'd found the path and were making steady progress toward the Frostmere. The three of them walked together now, no longer two plus one but a unit. Tavis and Korrin talked quietly, not rehashing the past but asking about the present. What Tavis had been doing, where Korrin had traveled, the simple catching-up of family reconnecting.
Sefiathan walked slightly behind them, giving them space, and thought about his seventeen pages. The ones he hadn't written but had been composing in his head. All the prepared speeches for his father, his mother, his sister. All the arguments about why they'd wronged him, why he'd been justified in leaving, why they owed him apologies.
What if he just—didn't? What if he let the speeches burn before he ever delivered them? Showed up without a script, without defenses, without the carefully constructed arguments?
What if he let himself be disrupted by the reality of who they were now instead of being trapped by who they'd been when he left?
The thought terrified him. And also—felt like breathing.
His melody hummed in his chest, and tonight it had a quality of openness. Not planned, not practiced, not perfectly prepared. Just—ready to be disrupted. Ready to have the suffocating blanket pulled away. Ready to breathe.
The path wound north. The Frostmere grew closer.
And Sefiathan walked toward it without a script, without seventeen pages, without the protection of perfect preparation.
Just walking. Just breathing. Just ready for whatever disruption came next.
Because the shake-up he feared most contained exactly what he needed.Feb 4
