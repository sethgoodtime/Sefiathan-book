**Day 43 — February 12, 2026**

Sefiathan woke knowing he was going to have an argument with Tavis, and the knowing made him tired before breakfast.

It started at the communal fire. Tavis was explaining—again—his theory about wind-reader methodology, how they could improve their accuracy if they incorporated astronomical calculations, cross-referenced with historical weather patterns, maybe developed a standardized notation system. He had the pleased, energized look of someone who'd found a problem to solve, completely oblivious to the fact that the wind-readers weren't asking for solutions.

Korrin was listening with his usual patience, occasionally nodding, offering the kind of non-committal sounds that could mean agreement or just acknowledgment of noise. Sefiathan sat down with his porridge and tried to let it wash over him. Tried to just eat his breakfast. Tried not to care.

Tavis turned to him. "What do you think? You've been studying with Orvenna. Does she use any kind of systematic approach, or is it all intuitive?"

"I think," Sefiathan said carefully, "she listens to the wind. That's the system."

"Right, but how does she distinguish between actual information and just... wind?" Tavis gestured enthusiastically. "There must be some framework, some way of organizing the data—"

"It's not data."

"Well, not in the traditional sense, but all information can be—"

"Tavis." Sefiathan set down his bowl. "They don't want your help."

Tavis blinked. "I'm not trying to help. I'm just interested in understanding the methodology—"

"You're trying to fix something that isn't broken." Sefiathan felt the argument building in his chest, the old familiar heat. "You spent seventeen pages preparing to talk to your cousin because you couldn't trust that just showing up would be enough. And now you're doing it again. You can't just let the wind-readers do their thing. You have to find the flaw, propose the improvement, make yourself useful."

Korrin shifted slightly—not intervening, just present.

"I'm not trying to fix anything," Tavis said, and there was something defensive in his voice now. "I'm just curious. Is that not allowed?"

"Curiosity doesn't usually come with a proposal for standardized notation."

"So what, I'm just supposed to observe and not think about it?"

"You're supposed to respect that their tradition doesn't need your optimization." Sefiathan heard his voice getting louder. Heard himself doing exactly what he'd told himself he wouldn't do. "Not everything is a problem waiting for your solution."

"I never said it was a problem—"

"You don't have to say it. You walk around looking for inefficiencies like they're crimes. Like people doing things differently than you would is an insult to logic itself."

Tavis stood up. His face had gone pale except for two spots of color high on his cheeks. "At least I'm trying to understand things instead of just sitting around feeling things and calling it wisdom."

"At least I'm not so terrified of not being needed that I have to make myself indispensable everywhere I go."

The silence after that was sharp enough to cut.

Tavis turned and walked away. Not dramatically. Just left. Korrin exhaled slowly and looked at Sefiathan, and there was something in that look—not judgment, exactly. Something closer to recognition.

"That could have gone better," Korrin said.

"I know." Sefiathan stared at his cooling porridge. His hands were shaking. "I know."

He sat there for a while after Korrin left, sick with the familiar aftertaste of an argument—the righteous anger already curdling into something uglier. Because yes, Tavis could be exhausting with his relentless need to improve everything. But Sefiathan also knew he'd gone for the throat. Had identified Tavis's most tender place and poked it. Hard.

And for what? Because Tavis had annoyed him at breakfast? Because his pride demanded the last word?

Orvenna's voice in his head: *You keep fighting battles no one wins.*

He walked to the granite slab even though he knew Orvenna wouldn't have answers. Sat down in the cold. The ice sang its thin song. His thoughts spun their exhausting circles: he should apologize, but Tavis had started it, but no actually Sefiathan had escalated it, but Tavis really did need to hear that he was being overbearing, but there had been kinder ways to say it, but—

"You're arguing with him in your head now," Orvenna said without opening her eyes.

"Yeah."

"How's that working out?"

"I'm winning."

She almost smiled. "Are you."

Sefiathan breathed. His breath made clouds in the cold air. "I don't know how to stop," he said. "Once it starts. Once my pride gets involved. I have to win. Have to get the last word. Even when I know I'm making it worse."

"What are you afraid will happen if you lose?"

"I don't know. That I'll be wrong? That he'll think he won? That—" Sefiathan stopped. Thought about it. "That I'll disappear. That if I don't fight for my position, there won't be a position to hold."

"And how much of your life have you spent in that fight?"

Most of it. All of it. Every interaction with his father was a battle for visibility. Every conversation with peers in Millhaven was a calculation of status. Every relationship he'd ever had was measured by who won which argument, who got proven right, who maintained the upper hand.

"You said once I was allowed to be selfish with my life," Sefiathan said. "But what if I'm just selfish? What if that's all this is?"

"There's a difference," Orvenna said, "between protecting your time and picking fights because your pride can't survive someone being wrong at you." She opened her eyes. "You don't have to win arguments to exist. You just have to exist."

"That's easy for you to say."

"Yes," she agreed. "It is. And it'll be easy for you to say someday too, once you've stopped treating every disagreement like an existential threat."

Sefiathan sat there hating how right she was. Hating how exhausting it was to always be at war. Hating that he'd hurt Tavis—genuinely hurt him—because his pride couldn't let a small irritation stay small.

Below the ice, that deep presence hummed. Unmoved by argument. Unbothered by the question of who won.

"I should apologize," Sefiathan said.

"Probably," Orvenna said. "But not because you need to win his forgiveness. Just because you were an ass and he deserves to hear that you know it."

Sefiathan stood. His knees ached from the cold stone. He didn't know what he'd say to Tavis, didn't have a script prepared. Just had the tiredness of knowing he'd fed a fight that no one needed.

Maybe that was enough to start with.
