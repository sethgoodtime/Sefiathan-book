**Day 56 — February 25, 2026**

The afternoon brought exactly what the morning had promised: someone challenging Sefiathan's viewpoint, and his immediate, reflexive urge to apologize for having one in the first place.

It happened during a casual conversation near one of the cooking fires. Sefiathan had been talking with Calantha and a few others about wind-reading techniques—nothing formal, just sharing observations—when a woman named Jessith joined the circle.

"I don't think that's quite right," she said after Sefiathan described how he'd learned to feel the difference between surface winds and deeper currents. Her tone was pleasant enough, but there was something dismissive underneath it. "The standard method is to start with breath work, not physical sensation. You're approaching it backwards."

Sefiathan felt the familiar tightening in his chest. The immediate scramble to reconsider. Maybe she was right. Maybe he'd misunderstood Orvenna's teaching. Maybe he should—

He stopped himself. Felt the weight of yesterday's raw words still echoing in his body. The careful words weren't working because they weren't true.

"That might be the standard method," he said slowly, hearing his own voice sound less apologetic than usual. "But it's not the method I'm using. Orvenna taught me to start with physical sensation. It works for me."

"But the standard method is standard for a reason," Jessith pressed. "It's been refined over generations. Starting with breath work creates a more stable foundation. Physical sensation alone can be misleading."

There it was. The suggestion that his way was wrong. That the experts knew better. That he should adjust his approach to match what she considered correct.

The old Sefiathan would have immediately backpedaled. Would have said something like "Oh, you're probably right, I'm still learning," or "I'll definitely try it that way instead." Would have treated her disagreement as evidence that he'd made a mistake.

But something had shifted. Yesterday's outburst had loosened something in him. He'd said the raw truth out loud and survived it. Maybe he could do it again. Smaller scale. But still honest.

"It might be misleading for you," Sefiathan said, keeping his voice level. "It works for me. Orvenna's method involves listening to what the ground is saying through physical sensation first, then expanding from there. That's what I'm doing."

Jessith's expression flickered—surprise, maybe, or annoyance. "I'm just trying to help you avoid developing bad habits."

"I appreciate the concern." The words came out more flat than Sefiathan intended. "But I'm not looking for help right now. I'm sharing what I've learned. You don't have to agree with it."

The circle went quiet. Calantha was watching with barely concealed amusement. One of the others—a young man whose name Sefiathan hadn't caught—looked vaguely uncomfortable, like witnessing a minor traffic accident.

"I'm not saying you have to change," Jessith said, her tone cooling. "I'm just pointing out that there are better methods. More established ones."

"For you, maybe. Not for me."

"You're being defensive."

And there it was. The trump card. The suggestion that his refusal to immediately accommodate was itself a character flaw. That standing his ground was the same as being unreasonable.

Sefiathan felt anger flare in his chest. Not the wild, unfocused anger of the past few days. Something sharper. More precise. Anger that knew exactly what it was angry at.

"I'm not being defensive," he said quietly. "I'm declining your advice. Those aren't the same thing."

Jessith stared at him for a long moment. Her mouth opened like she was about to say something else, then closed. She stood abruptly, brushing invisible dust from her cloak. "Well. If you don't want help, I won't waste my time offering it."

She walked away. The remaining people in the circle exchanged glances—some awkward, some approving. Calantha was openly grinning now.

"That was fun to watch," she said once Jessith was out of earshot.

Sefiathan's hands were shaking slightly. The adrenaline of confrontation was still coursing through him. "I feel like I just did something terrible."

"You stood your ground." Calantha's voice was matter-of-fact. "You said no without apologizing for it. That's not terrible. That's just uncomfortable for people who aren't used to hearing no from you."

The young man—Derrin, someone finally said his name—shifted uncomfortably. "She was just trying to help, though. Seems harsh to shut her down like that."

"She was trying to be right," Sefiathan corrected, feeling the anger still sharp and present. "There's a difference. Helping would have been saying 'here's another method if you're interested.' What she did was tell me my method was wrong and I should do it her way instead."

"But what if her way is actually better?" Derrin pressed. "What if you're missing out on a more effective method because you're being stubborn?"

Sefiathan looked at him directly. Recognized the pattern. The way questions like that were designed to make you second-guess yourself. To treat your own certainty as presumptuous.

"Then I'll miss out," he said simply. "I'd rather commit fully to the method I'm learning than half-ass two different methods because I'm worried I might be wrong. Orvenna is teaching me her way. I'm going to learn her way completely before I decide whether to try something else."

"That seems close-minded."

"It seems focused." Sefiathan felt the words coming clearer now, more certain. "You can call it stubborn or close-minded or defensive. I call it actually learning something instead of constantly hedging my bets in case someone else knows better."

Derrin looked away, clearly uncomfortable. Calantha was still grinning. Another woman in the circle—older, with the weathered look of someone who'd spent years in harsh climates—nodded slowly.

"Jessith does that a lot," the older woman said. "Offers 'help' that's really just criticism dressed up nicer. Good for you for not taking the bait."

Sefiathan felt something settle in his chest. The anger was fading but leaving behind something solid. Not peace exactly. More like... ground. Like he'd found footing he didn't know he was missing.

He didn't need to say sorry. Didn't need to apologize for having a viewpoint. Didn't need to immediately reconsider just because someone disagreed. Their disagreement wasn't his failure. Their discomfort with his certainty wasn't his problem to fix.

The conversation moved on to other topics. Sefiathan stayed quiet, processing what had just happened. He'd stood his ground without shrinking. Had said no without softening it. Had let Jessith be uncomfortable with his refusal instead of immediately trying to make it easier for her.

And the world hadn't ended.

Later, Sefiathan found himself walking alone near the edge of the gathering, replaying the interaction. Looking for the moment where he'd gone too far. Where he'd been unnecessarily harsh or defensive or stubborn.

But he couldn't find it. He'd stated his position clearly. Declined her advice directly. Refused to let her reframe his certainty as a character flaw. All without cruelty. Without attacking her. Just—standing in his own space and not apologizing for taking it up.

Korrin appeared beside him, moving with that peculiar quiet that large creatures sometimes managed. "You look like you're trying to find something wrong with yourself."

"I told someone no today. Pretty directly. I'm trying to figure out if I was too harsh."

"Were you cruel?"

"No."

"Did you attack her personally?"

"No. I just—I refused to change my mind when she suggested I was doing it wrong."

"Then you weren't too harsh." Korrin's tone was absolute. "You were clear. People who are used to you being soft will call clarity harshness. That's their problem, not yours."

Sefiathan nodded slowly. Felt the truth of that settle into the solid ground in his chest. Jessith had been uncomfortable with his certainty. Had tried to soften it by suggesting it was really defensiveness, or stubbornness, or close-mindedness. Had tried to make his refusal into a flaw he should examine.

But it wasn't. It was just—no. Clear and direct and unapologetic.

His ideas mattered. His method was valid. Her disagreement wasn't evidence that he was wrong.

He didn't need to say sorry for that.

The fight—if you could even call it that—felt significant in a way Sefiathan was still processing. Not because of what was said. Because of what wasn't. He hadn't backed down. Hadn't softened his position to make Jessith comfortable. Hadn't treated her disagreement as more valid than his own experience.

He'd stood his ground without shrinking.

And it turned out that was allowed.
