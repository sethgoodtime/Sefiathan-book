Day 20: The Ones You've Lost Touch With

The river bent east in the late morning, and Sefiathan had a choice: follow it, or cut north through denser forest and trust Maren's map. He chose north, leaving the water's constant company for the first time in days.

The forest closed in around him—thicker undergrowth, older trees, the kind of deep wilderness that felt unaccustomed to human presence. Sefiathan moved carefully, watching his footing, mindful of his ankle even though it had healed well.

He'd been walking maybe an hour when he found the marker.

Not the cairns he'd been leaving, or the scratches on trees he'd been following. This was deliberate—a wooden post driven into the ground, weathered but still standing, with names carved into it. Dozens of them, layered over each other, some fresh, some so old they were barely legible.

Sefiathan ran his fingers over the carvings, trying to read them:

*Tomas & Renn, Spring 1023*
*For Mother - K*
*The Crossroads Crew*
*Remembering Dall*
*Lyssa, I'm sorry*

A memorial post. Or maybe a message board. A place where travelers had stopped to mark their passage, to remember people, to reach out across distance and time to someone they'd lost touch with.

Sefiathan stood there for a long moment, pack heavy on his shoulders, thinking about names he hadn't thought about in weeks.

His sister, Elara. They'd fought before he left—not violently, but with the kind of harsh honesty that comes from knowing someone too well. She'd called him a coward. He'd called her judgmental. They'd both been right and both been cruel, and he'd left without really resolving it.

His childhood friend Darius, who'd moved to Greymark three years ago for work. They'd promised to stay in touch, had managed it for maybe six months, then life had filled in the gaps and they'd just—stopped. Not from any bad feeling. Just from the gradual drift that happens when you're not in each other's daily orbit anymore.

His father's apprentice, Mira, who'd been better at carpentry than Sefiathan ever was and had made him feel simultaneously inadequate and genuinely happy for her success. They'd been friends, sort of. Or friendly. And then she'd gotten her journeyman certification and moved to a bigger town, and Sefiathan had been too caught up in his own shame to keep the connection alive.

People he'd lost touch with. Not through any dramatic falling out. Just through the slow accumulation of days without contact, the gradual cooling of connections that weren't actively maintained.

Standing at the memorial post, deep in the Wildlands with no way to actually reach any of these people, Sefiathan felt the loss of them. Not grief exactly, but a kind of low-grade longing. The recognition that he'd let relationships fade because reaching out felt awkward after too much silence.

*That friend who stopped texting back? They're probably wondering about you too.*

The words from somewhere, maybe overheard at an inn, maybe his mother saying them once. It didn't matter. They landed now, in this moment, with this weathered post full of names.

Sefiathan pulled out his knife—the hunting knife from Maren, sharp and well-balanced—and found a clear spot on the post. Then he carved, slowly and carefully:

*Elara - your brother is learning not to be a coward. I'm sorry I left angry.*

Below that:

*Darius - I miss our stupid arguments about nothing. The conversation won't be as awkward as I think.*

And finally:

*Mira - you were always better at carpentry than me. That's okay. I'm finding other things.*

He stepped back and looked at what he'd written. The post wouldn't deliver these messages. Elara wouldn't see her name carved in a memorial post in the deep Wildlands. Darius wouldn't know Sefiathan had thought of him. Mira would never read the acknowledgment.

But that wasn't the point.

The point was acknowledging the loss, the gradual drift, the connections he'd let atrophy because reaching out felt uncomfortable. The point was naming the people who mattered, even if they'd never know he'd done it.

Sefiathan shouldered his pack and kept walking north, but his mind stayed with the memorial post. With all those names carved by travelers who'd stopped long enough to remember someone, to reach across distance with words that might never be received.

By midday, he'd made a decision.

When he got home—not now, not yet, but eventually when this year was done—he'd reach out. To Elara first, because she deserved an apology that wasn't carved into wood in a place she'd never see. To Darius, because the awkwardness of reconnecting would be worth it. To Mira, because acknowledging someone's excellence didn't diminish you.

The conversation wouldn't be as awkward as he thought. Or maybe it would be, and that would be okay too. Awkward was better than silence. Imperfect connection was better than none at all.

That evening, making camp near a small clearing where ancient trees created a natural circle, Sefiathan pulled out his journal. Not to process lessons, but to keep the names clear in his mind:

*Elara - my sister who called me a coward and was right*
*Darius - my friend who moved away and I let him go*
*Mira - my father's apprentice who was better than me at everything*

Then he added more:

*The people at the Crossroads Post whose names I never learned*
*The silent woman who made me soup*
*Torval and Mikken and Lyrei, who showed up for three days*
*Maren, who called me a ridge walker*

People who'd touched his life. Some briefly, some longer. All of them mattering in ways he hadn't fully acknowledged until now.

Sefiathan looked at the list and felt something loosen in his chest. He'd been so focused on his own journey, his own growth, his own search for purpose that he'd forgotten: people mattered. Connections mattered. Even the ones you'd lost touch with, even the brief encounters, even the relationships that had faded through neglect rather than intention.

They all left marks. They all deserved acknowledgment.

On a fresh page, he wrote words that wanted to become something:

*I carved your names in weathered wood*
*In forests you will never see*
*The conversations we never had*
*Still echo in the space between*

*The friend who moved away*
*The sister I left angry*
*The apprentice better than I was*
*All the bridges burned by silence*

*But bridges burned can be rebuilt*
*And silence broken by a word*
*The awkwardness I feared so much*
*Is smaller than the love it guards*

Not good poetry. Clumsy rhymes and forced meter. But honest. Raw. The kind of first thought he was learning to trust instead of edit to death.

Sefiathan closed the journal and sat by his fire, watching the flames dance in the gathering dark. Tomorrow he'd reach the Singing Stones, whatever they were. But tonight he carried the weight of names—people he'd lost touch with, people he missed, people he'd let drift away through the slow erosion of not reaching out.

When he got home, he'd fix that. Or try to. The conversations might be awkward. Some people might not want to reconnect. But he'd try anyway, because the alternative was letting more connections fade into memorial posts carved in places no one would see.

His melody came to him as he settled into sleep, and tonight it carried the names with it—Elara, Darius, Mira, all the others. The song was becoming more than just his own voice. It was becoming a catalog of connections, of people who'd shaped him, of relationships that mattered even in their absence.

One more day to the Singing Stones.

And then—well, he'd figure out what came next when he got there.

But first, he'd remember the names. Hold them carefully. Promise to reach out when this journey brought him home.

The conversation wouldn't be as awkward as he thought.

And even if it was, that would be okay.
