Day 21: The Singing Stones

Sefiathan heard them before he saw them.

He'd been walking since dawn, following Maren's map north through increasingly sparse forest. The massive old growth had given way to younger trees, then to scattered groves, then to open meadowland dotted with rock formations. And somewhere around midmorning, the sound reached him.

Singing.

Not voices exactly—more like wind through hollow spaces, but musical. Harmonic. Like someone had built an instrument out of stone and left it for the weather to play.

The sound grew louder as he walked, pulling him forward across the meadow toward a cluster of standing stones. Tall pillars of dark rock, maybe fifteen feet high, arranged in a loose circle. Wind moved through gaps and holes in the stone, creating that ethereal music—low notes and high notes weaving together, constantly shifting as the breeze changed direction.

The Singing Stones.

Sefiathan stood at the edge of the stone circle, listening. The music was beautiful in a wild, untamed way. Not composed or intentional, just physics and geology and wind combining into something that sounded like purpose.

He walked into the circle slowly, aware that he was entering a space that felt—not sacred exactly, but significant. The stones rose around him, their surfaces worn smooth by centuries of weather, holes and channels carved by water and wind creating the instruments that gave this place its name.

And Sefiathan realized: he was alone.

Not just alone—he'd been alone for weeks now, traveling through the Wildlands. But alone in a way that felt different. No destination pulling him forward anymore. No memorial post to discover. No injury forcing him to stop. Just—here. In this place he'd traveled three days to reach, with the stones singing around him and nothing he had to do except be present.

The urge to fill the space with activity rose immediately. To explore, to investigate, to figure out what the Singing Stones were for, to find some lesson or purpose in reaching them. To document them, to make sense of them, to turn this moment into something productive.

Instead, Sefiathan dropped his pack, sat down with his back against one of the singing stones, and did nothing.

Just sat. Listened. Existed.

The stone was warm from the sun. The wind moved through the circle, creating shifting harmonies. Somewhere in the distance, birds called. His body was tired from three days of walking, but in the good way—the ache of muscles well-used, not the pain of injury.

And he was still having fun.

That realization landed quietly, without fanfare. He was still enjoying this. The journey, the solitude, the discovery of places like this. He hadn't burned out or gotten bored or reached the point where he needed to escape back to company and comfort.

He was still having fun being alone with himself.

Sefiathan sat against the singing stone for what might have been an hour, might have been three. Time felt different here, less urgent. The sun moved across the sky. The wind shifted, and the stones' music changed with it. His mind wandered—to home, to the people he'd lost touch with, to the melody he'd written, to nothing in particular.

It was the most peaceful he'd been since leaving Millhaven.

Eventually—because his body needed things even when his mind was content—Sefiathan stood and set up a proper camp. Not quick and functional like he'd been doing, but intentional. He chose the best spot for his sleeping area, arranged rocks for his fire pit with care, gathered extra wood so he wouldn't have to search for it later.

He was staying here for a while. Not out of necessity. Just because he wanted to.

As afternoon faded toward evening, Sefiathan realized what had been missing from the past few days: he'd been so focused on reaching the Singing Stones that he'd forgotten to notice whether he was actually enjoying the journey. Had been treating it like a task to complete rather than an experience to have.

But sitting here now, with no deadline and no next destination calling, he could feel it clearly: he was having fun. The solitude fed something in him that company couldn't. The long days of walking alone, the evenings by the fire, the practice of relying entirely on himself—it wasn't draining him. It was filling him up.

That night, Sefiathan made an elaborate meal—not because he had special ingredients, but because he had time and attention to give it. He foraged around the stone circle, finding wild onions and herbs and greens he recognized from the guidebook. Cooked everything slowly, tasted and adjusted, turned the basic supplies he carried into something that felt like celebration.

Not celebrating anything specific. Just—being here. Being content. Still having fun.

After eating, he lay on his back in the center of the stone circle, looking up at stars appearing in the darkening sky. The stones sang around him, wind playing them like instruments. And Sefiathan felt something he hadn't felt in a long time: the desire to stay. Not to keep moving, not to find the next thing, not to chase some destination or goal.

Just to be here, in this moment, for as long as it felt good.

Tomorrow he could leave. Could head back to the Crossroads Post, or continue north into deeper wilderness, or turn east toward the Emerald Expanse, or make any number of other choices.

But tonight—and maybe tomorrow, and maybe the next few days—he'd stay here. With the singing stones and the open sky and his own company.

Because he was still having fun. And when you were still having fun, there was no reason to leave early just because you could.

His melody came to him as he lay under the stars, and tonight it had a quality of arrival. Not completion—the song was still itself, still imperfect, still searching in places. But arrived at a moment of contentment. A pause in the journey where you could rest and appreciate where you were without immediately needing to move toward where you might be next.

The stones sang their wind-music. Sefiathan hummed his melody. And somewhere in the harmony between stone-song and human-song, there was peace.

He'd go home when he was ready. Would reconnect with people when the time was right. Would figure out his purpose and power and all the things he'd left Millhaven seeking.

But not tonight.

Tonight he was alone in a stone circle in the meadowlands north of the Deepwood, still having fun, still enjoying his own company, still finding reasons to stay rather than reasons to leave.

And that was enough.

More than enough.

It was exactly right.
