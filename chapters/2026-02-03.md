Day 34 - February 3, 2026
They reached the edge of the Frostmere territory by late afternoon. The landscape had transformed completely—no longer mountain slopes but a vast expanse of frozen marshland stretching north toward distant ice peaks. The ground was hard with frost, and strange formations of ice rose from the flats like sculptures. The air held an eerie quality, sound traveling differently here, distances deceptive.
"The gathering is two days further," Korrin said, studying the terrain. "There's a waystation tonight—a shelter maintained by the wind-readers. We should reach it before dark."
They walked across the frozen marsh in single file, stepping carefully. The ice formations cast long shadows in the slanting light, creating patterns that looked almost intentional. Almost like writing.
"It's beautiful," Sefiathan said.
"It's dangerous," Tavis replied. "The Frostmere doesn't care about beauty. It just is what it is, and you survive it or you don't."
"Both can be true," Korrin said mildly.
They reached the waystation as the sun touched the horizon—a sturdy structure built partially into a rise in the frozen ground, designed to withstand harsh weather. Inside, it was simple but well-maintained. A fire pit, sleeping platforms, supplies left by previous travelers and wind-readers for those who came after.
As they settled in and built a fire, Tavis spoke. "Can I ask you something?" They were looking at Sefiathan. "Yesterday, in the cave. Why didn't you tell me I was being stupid? About the seventeen pages?"
"Was that what you needed to hear?"
"Probably. But you didn't say it."
Sefiathan thought about that while he helped Korrin prepare food. "I guess—I didn't think my opinion of your choices mattered as much as your own experience of them. You figured out they were suffocating you. Me telling you that wouldn't have helped, would have just been—noise."
"Most people would have said something," Tavis insisted. "Would have had an opinion about what I should do."
"I have lots of opinions," Sefiathan admitted. "But they're just—my perspective. Not truth. You were living it. I was just watching."
Korrin looked up from the pot they were stirring. "That's rare. People usually can't resist offering their perspective as if it's objective truth."
"My father does that," Sefiathan said. "Tells me what I'm doing wrong like it's fact, not opinion. Like there's one right way to be a person and he knows it and I'm failing at it."
"And how does that feel?"
"Like I'm constantly being measured against a standard I can't see and always coming up short." He accepted the bowl of food Korrin handed him. "But it's just his perspective. His opinion of how a person should be. Doesn't make it truth."
They ate in comfortable silence for a while. The fire crackled, warming the small space. Outside, the Frostmere settled into its strange frozen stillness.
"I spent two years treating Korrin's criticism like it was objective truth," Tavis said quietly. "Like they'd identified a fundamental flaw in me. Something broken that needed fixing." They poked at their food. "But it was just—their opinion. Their perspective from their own struggles. Not truth about me."
"Took me a long time to separate those things," Korrin said. "My opinion from actual truth. I'd get so certain about what people should do, how they should handle things. Couldn't see that I was just—projecting my own fears and needs onto everyone around me."
Sefiathan thought about all the times he'd treated other people's opinions as if they were facts. His father's disappointment as proof of his inadequacy. His sister's ease with numbers as evidence of his own failing. The village elder's gentle suggestion that he wasn't meant for magic as confirmation of some fundamental lack.
All of it just—perspective. Opinion. One way of seeing among infinite ways of seeing.
Not truth.
"How do you tell the difference?" he asked. "Between opinion and truth?"
"Truth is usually simpler," Korrin said. "Like—you need to eat to live. That's truth. Whether you should eat meat or only plants or six small meals or three big ones—that's opinion. People dress opinion up as truth all the time. Make it sound certain and absolute. But underneath, it's just—their best guess based on incomplete information."
"My instincts got me this far," Sefiathan said, almost to himself. "That's truth. Whether I'm doing it 'right' according to anyone else's standard—that's opinion."
"What do your instincts say now?" Tavis asked.
Sefiathan sat with the question. His instincts had led him to leave Millhaven, to travel with Torval and the others briefly, to spend time at the Singing Stones, to walk with Korrin, to chase across dangerous terrain in a storm to help Tavis. Every choice had felt right in the moment, even when he couldn't explain why.
"They say keep going north," he said. "To the gathering. Even though I don't know what I'm looking for there."
"And what does the noise say?" Korrin asked. "All the opinions and should-dos and proper-ways?"
"That I'm wasting time. That I should have a clearer goal. That I should know what I'm doing by now. That real journeys have purposes and plans and—" He stopped. "But that's just noise. People's opinions about how journeys should look. Not truth about mine."
The fire settled into steady burning. Outside, something cracked in the cold—ice shifting, or a frozen branch giving way. The Frostmere's night-sounds.
"At the gathering," Tavis said, "there will be people with strong opinions about everything. How to read wind, what it means, what you should do with the information. Some of them will sound very certain."
"How do you handle that?"
"Remember they're working with incomplete information. Same as everyone. Their certainty is just—confidence in their perspective. Doesn't make it truth." Tavis pulled their blanket tighter. "The wind-readers who've been studying longest are usually the least certain. They've seen enough to know how much they don't know."
Sefiathan thought about that. How certainty and wisdom seemed to move in opposite directions. The more you knew, the less certain you could be. Only people working with incomplete information could afford complete certainty.
His father had been very certain about Sefiathan's failings. But he'd only seen one perspective, one slice of a whole person's life. His certainty was just—confidence in incomplete information.
Not truth.
"I think I've been treating everyone's comments about me like breaking news," Sefiathan said. "Like each criticism was revealing some new truth about my fundamental flaws. But they were just—opinions. Perspectives. People's best guesses based on what they could see from where they stood."
"Which was incomplete," Korrin added.
"Which was incomplete," Sefiathan agreed.
They settled into their sleeping spaces, the fire burning low, the waystation warm and secure. Outside, the Frostmere stretched vast and frozen, indifferent to human opinions about how things should be. It simply was—cold, beautiful, dangerous, all of it true at once.
Sefiathan lay in his blankets thinking about trust. How he'd been trusting everyone's opinions about him more than his own instincts. Treating external perspectives as if they had access to truth while his internal knowing was just—wishful thinking or self-delusion.
But his instincts had gotten him this far. Had led him to people who mattered, places that changed him, moments that taught him. They weren't perfect, weren't infallible, but they were his. And they'd proven more reliable than the noise of other people's certainty.
His melody hummed in his chest, and tonight it had a quality of self-trust. Not arrogant certainty, but quiet confidence. The sound of someone learning to distinguish between opinion and truth, between noise and instinct, between other people's perspectives and their own knowing.
Tomorrow they'd continue to the gathering. There would be opinions there—probably many, probably confident ones. People would have thoughts about what Sefiathan should do, who he should be, what his journey should mean.
And he could listen to them as perspectives while trusting his instincts to sort truth from noise.
Everything they'd say would be opinion, not fact.
Everything he'd see would be perspective, not truth.
And underneath all of it, his instincts would know. Would guide. Would lead him where he needed to go next, even if he couldn't explain why to anyone's satisfaction.
The waystation settled into sleep-sounds—breathing, the fire crackling, the wind outside finding gaps and singing through them.
And Sefiathan rested in the knowing that he could trust himself.
Not perfectly. Not certainly.
But enough.
More than enough.
Exactly enough.Feb 4
