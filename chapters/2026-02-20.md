**Day 51 — February 20, 2026**

Sefiathan woke up angry.

Not at anything specific. Not at anyone in particular. Just angry—a hot, restless feeling coiled in his chest like something alive and looking for a target. He lay in his tent trying to identify the source, trace it back to some triggering thought or memory, but it wouldn't resolve into anything concrete. Just anger. Raw and directionless.

He got dressed with sharp movements, yanking his clothes on harder than necessary. Emerged into the grey morning light already tight-jawed, already looking for something to justify the feeling.

The gathering was its usual morning self—people tending fires, preparing food, going about their business with that easy competence that suddenly seemed performative. Look at all of us being so functional, so purposeful, so together. It grated on him. Made the anger coil tighter.

Korrin was near the edge of the gathering, eating something that looked like dried fruit mixed with grain. He saw Sefiathan approaching and lifted a hand in greeting.

"Don't," Sefiathan said. Heard how sharp it came out. Didn't soften it.

Korrin lowered his hand. "Alright."

"I'm not—" Sefiathan stopped. Started again. "I'm angry and I don't know why and I don't want to talk about it."

"Then don't."

"But you're going to ask me what's wrong and I'm going to have to explain that nothing's wrong, nothing happened, I'm just angry for no reason and that's going to sound ridiculous."

"I wasn't going to ask." Korrin went back to his breakfast. "You already told me you don't want to talk about it. I can hear."

The reasonable response made Sefiathan angrier. He wanted Korrin to push, to insist on knowing what was wrong, to give him something to push back against. Instead Korrin just sat there, eating his breakfast, completely unbothered by Sefiathan's mood.

"I'm going for a walk," Sefiathan said.

"Sounds good."

He walked. Stomped, really. Let his boots hit the frozen ground harder than necessary, let his body move with the sharp energy that wanted out. The Frostmere stretched around him, indifferent to his mood, which somehow made it worse. Everything just continuing on like his anger wasn't even worth acknowledging.

By the time he'd walked far enough that the gathering was distant behind him, the anger had shifted. Still there, still hot, but now it had found targets. His father, of course—always an easy mark. His father who'd looked at him like a disappointing puzzle, who'd handed all his tools to Mira instead, who'd never once asked what Sefiathan actually wanted. And his mother, too, while he was at it. His mother who was so gentle with her plants and so distant with him. Who spoke to flowers in low, loving tones but couldn't seem to find words for her own son.

And Mira. Perfect Mira who fit so naturally into the space Sefiathan was supposed to fill. Who made it look effortless. Who probably didn't even realize she'd taken something from him because to her it was just normal competence, just doing what came naturally.

The anger felt good. Felt righteous. Felt like finally letting himself feel what he'd been too careful to feel for years. They'd all failed him in their different ways and he'd spent his whole life making excuses for them, finding reasons why it was actually fine, actually his fault, actually not worth being angry about.

But it wasn't fine. And he was angry. And for once he was going to let himself feel it without immediately diffusing it into understanding and forgiveness and all the other ways he usually made himself smaller to avoid conflict.

He walked until his legs ached and the anger started losing its edge. Sat down on a flat rock that jutted from the frozen ground. Let himself breathe.

The thing about anger, he was discovering, was that it didn't actually need a target to be valid. He'd been trying to trace it back to source—find the reason, identify the wound, understand the why. But maybe it was just anger. Maybe after years of swallowing every small hurt and large disappointment, of smiling through pain and joking past injury, of making himself pleasant and unthreatening and easy to be around, maybe he'd just accumulated enough unexpressed feeling that sometimes it surfaced as undirected rage.

And maybe that was allowed.

He pulled out the strange carved creature from yesterday—still in his pocket, smooth from unconscious handling. Turned it over in his hands while he sat with the anger. Let it be there without needing to explain it or justify it or immediately forgive whoever it was aimed at.

His father had failed him. That was true. His mother had been distant. Also true. Mira had taken his place with an ease that stung. Still true. And he'd spent years telling himself these things didn't matter, weren't worth anger, weren't worth the conflict that acknowledging them would create.

But they did matter. They were worth anger. The hurt was real even if he'd spent years pretending it wasn't.

The question was what to do with it.

He could hold onto it. Feed it. Let it become the central story of his life—the boy whose father never saw him, whose mother loved her garden more, whose role was stolen by someone more competent. That story would work. Would give shape to all the shapeless pain. Would justify the anger and make it righteous and pure.

Or he could feel it. Really feel it, all the way through, without needing it to become a story. Could let himself be angry at his father and his mother and Mira and everyone else who'd failed him in small and large ways. Could acknowledge the hurt was real and valid and worth feeling. And then could choose whether holding onto it was actually serving him or just giving him someone to blame.

The second option felt harder. Required more of him. Required actually sitting with the anger instead of using it as fuel for revenge fantasies or justification for bitterness. Required feeling the hurt without letting it calcify into permanent grievance.

He thought about the burn book he'd been carrying for months—that careful catalog of every slight and injury and disappointment. How satisfying it had felt to maintain. How clear everything became when sorted into categories of wrong done to him. How simple life was when you knew exactly who to blame for your pain.

He'd burned that book weeks ago. But the impulse that created it was still there—still wanting to catalog and categorize and preserve every hurt as evidence. Still wanting someone to be guilty so he could be innocent.

The anger was still hot in his chest. Still real. Still valid.

But he could feel it without weaponizing it. Could acknowledge his father failed him without making his father the villain of his life story. Could admit Mira's competence stung without turning her into the enemy. Could be angry at his mother's distance without needing that anger to become his defining wound.

He could just feel it. Let it move through him. Let it be temporary instead of permanent.

The carved creature in his hands was neither beautiful nor ugly. Just strange. Just itself. Not trying to be anything else. Not apologizing for its oddness. Just existing in its own particular shape.

Like anger. Just existing. Just real. Not good or bad. Not justified or unjustified. Just a feeling that wanted to be felt.

Sefiathan stood. Started walking back toward the gathering. The anger was quieter now but not gone. He didn't try to make it go away. Didn't smile through it or joke past it or pretend he was fine when he wasn't.

Just let it be there. Present and real and temporary.

When he got back to the gathering, Korrin looked up from whatever he'd been doing. Took in Sefiathan's face. Said nothing.

"I'm still angry," Sefiathan said. "But it's not at you."

"Good to know."

"I might be angry for a while."

"That's allowed."

Sefiathan nodded. Sat down near the fire. Let himself be angry in the presence of someone who didn't need him to be anything else.

The loaded gun was still there. But he'd walked away. Cooled down. Decided the damage wasn't worth it.

For now, that was enough.
