Day 19: First Thoughts

The words came while Sefiathan was walking.

Not planned, not rehearsed—just there, forming in his head with the rhythm of his footsteps. He'd been following the river valley north for maybe two hours, his mind pleasantly empty of the usual noise, when suddenly he was composing.

*The forest holds you while you break / The ugly birds still learn to fly / The songs are finished when you make / Them yours instead of perfect—*

Sefiathan stopped walking. Grabbed his journal from his pack before the words could slip away. Wrote them down exactly as they'd appeared, no editing, no second-guessing. Just the raw thought, rough-edged and unpolished.

He stared at what he'd written. It wasn't good. The rhythm was clumsy, the rhyme felt forced, the whole thing had an awkward amateur quality that made him want to immediately cross it out and start over.

But that was the old pattern—the editing-to-death, the sanitizing, the endless revision that turned raw thoughts into nothing at all.

Sefiathan left the words exactly as they were and kept walking.

More came throughout the morning. Fragments, half-formed ideas, things that wanted to be poems or songs or just observations about the world:

*Ankle taught me patience has its own timeline*

*The voice that says you're not enough is lying but persistent*

*Maren makes soup for strangers / Like my mother tended gardens / Like showing up is just what some people do*

None of it was polished. All of it was true. And writing it down without immediately revising felt like learning a new language—the language of first thoughts, unedited and imperfect.

By midday, Sefiathan had filled three pages with rough lines and fragmentary observations. Some of it was terrible. Some of it might be good, though he couldn't tell yet. All of it was his—unfiltered, immediate, the raw version instead of the sanitized one.

He stopped for lunch near a fallen tree that created a natural bench. Made tea with the herbs he'd been carrying, ate dried fruit and hardtack, and read back over what he'd written that morning.

The urge to edit was overwhelming. To fix the clumsy rhythms, smooth out the rough edges, make it sound like something worth showing people. But he recognized that urge for what it was: the need to sanitize, to make himself presentable, to turn raw honesty into polished performance.

Instead, Sefiathan turned to a fresh page and wrote:

*I'm learning not to overthink it. The words come easily when I trust the first thing that pops into my head. All those years of editing myself into silence—trying to find the perfect thing to say instead of just saying the thing. But people want raw thoughts, not the sanitized version. Or at least, I want to offer raw thoughts. Want to be the kind of person who speaks first drafts instead of endless revisions.*

He paused, read it back, felt the familiar itch to revise. Resisted.

*This is hard. Leaving thoughts unedited feels like walking around with my shirt inside out—like everyone will see the messy seams and unfinished edges. But imperfect action beats perfect hesitation. And what am I hesitating for anyway? No one's reading this. This is just me, learning to think without immediately censoring.*

The afternoon walk continued with more words appearing:

*Three days to Singing Stones that I know nothing about*

*Following rough maps like they're enough / (they are)*

*The cleared path I left for strangers / The wooden bird I carved and left behind / Small gifts for people I'll never meet / This is how you show up in the world*

Sefiathan wrote them all down as they came. Some in his journal while walking, which resulted in messy handwriting and words that slanted off the page. Some when he stopped to rest, scrawled quickly before they could evaporate. All of them first drafts, none of them revised.

That evening, making camp near a bend in the river, Sefiathan realized something: he'd spent the entire day creating. Not perfectly, not with any grand plan, just—putting words down as they appeared. Trusting first thoughts. Letting imperfection exist without immediately trying to fix it.

And it felt good. Felt like unlocking something that had been stuck for years.

He made dinner with more attention than usual—adding foraged greens to the dried fish, taking time to season it properly with the wild garlic and herbs he'd found. Not because he had to, but because creating in one area seemed to spill over into others. When you stopped overthinking words, you also stopped overthinking food, camp setup, everything.

After eating, Sefiathan pulled out his journal one more time. The pages were full of rough thoughts, unedited fragments, ideas that might go somewhere or might just be today's observations. He read through them, resisting the urge to revise, just witnessing what he'd created.

Some of it was definitely bad. Clumsy metaphors, forced rhymes, thoughts that trailed off mid-sentence. But some of it—some of it caught something true. Something that would have been lost if he'd stopped to perfect it before writing it down.

On a fresh page, he wrote:

*Day 19: Learning not to overthink it. Words came all day—rough, unedited, imperfect. I wrote them down anyway. Turns out first thoughts are usually more honest than revised thoughts. Turns out people (me) want raw honesty more than polished performance. Turns out imperfect action really does beat perfect hesitation.*

*Still two days from the Singing Stones. Still don't know what I'll find there. Still writing words that might be terrible. Still okay with all of it.*

He closed the journal and sat by his fire, listening to the river, watching stars appear in the darkening sky. His mind was quieter than usual—not empty, but calm. Like he'd released some pressure that had been building for years.

All those words he'd never said because they weren't perfect enough. All those thoughts he'd revised into nothing. All that silence created by overthinking instead of just speaking.

Today he'd practiced something different: trusting first thoughts, writing them down unedited, letting imperfection exist.

Tomorrow he'd do it again. And the day after. And maybe by the time he reached the Singing Stones, he'd have pages full of rough thoughts that were more honest than anything he could have created through careful revision.

His melody came to him as he settled into sleep, and tonight it included words for the first time—rough, unpolished words that matched the clumsy rhythm, but words nonetheless:

*The forest holds you while you break / And ugly birds still learn to fly / Your songs are finished when you make / Them yours instead of perfect*

Not good. Not polished. Not ready to be shared.

But his. And honest. And that was enough for Day Nineteen.

The words would keep coming. He'd keep writing them down. And slowly, through imperfect action and first thoughts and trusting what popped into his head, he'd learn to speak without endless revision.

The Singing Stones were two days north.

And Sefiathan was learning not to overthink it.
