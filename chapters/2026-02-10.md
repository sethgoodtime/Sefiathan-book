**Day 41 — February 10, 2026**

The morning was sharp and bright, the kind of cold that made breathing feel like swallowing knives. Sefiathan woke later than usual, still warm from the fire circle the night before — not physically warm, but something else, some internal heat that hadn't quite faded. He'd sung his song. He'd been himself. The world hadn't ended.

Korrin was already up, talking quietly with Tavis about route options. Calantha was nowhere to be seen, probably off doing whatever Calantha did when she wanted to be alone, which was most of the time. Normal morning sounds. Normal people doing normal things. And Sefiathan, for once, felt like he was part of the normalcy instead of watching it happen from outside the frame.

He made his way to Orvenna's granite perch expecting the usual — silent sitting, the occasional cryptic observation, the hum of whatever lived under the ice. But when he arrived, there was someone else there. A man, maybe forty, with dark skin and darker hair going grey at the temples, wearing layers of wool that looked like they'd been mended so many times they were more repair than original garment. He was standing in front of Orvenna, and even from a distance Sefiathan could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he held himself like he was braced against wind.

"—just tell me if I'm wasting my time," the man was saying. His voice had a quality like cracking ice. "Tell me if she's ever going to—"

"Maren," Orvenna said, and it was the first time Sefiathan had heard her voice carry anything like gentleness. "I can't tell you what she'll do. I can only tell you that standing here demanding certainty is costing you the morning."

"So that's it? Just accept that I don't know? Just live with this—" He gestured, furious and helpless at once. "This hanging?"

"Yes."

Maren laughed, bitter. "That's the worst advice I've ever heard."

"I didn't say it was advice. I said it was the truth." Orvenna opened her eyes and looked at him fully, which Sefiathan had learned was a rare gift. "You want me to tell you she'll come back, or that she won't. You want the story to be finished so you can stop carrying it. But love isn't a story with an ending. It's just a thing that happened, and is happening, and will keep happening whether she's here or not."

"That's—" Maren stopped. His hands opened and closed. "I can't just—"

"You can. You just don't want to." She closed her eyes again, returning to her usual stillness. "Go get breakfast. Stop interrogating the universe. It's not going to give you the answers you want."

Maren stood there for another few breaths, vibrating with something between rage and grief, and then he turned and walked away without seeing Sefiathan at all.

Sefiathan waited until he was gone, then approached carefully. "Should I come back later?"

"Sit down," Orvenna said. "You're already here."

He sat. The granite was cold enough that he could feel it through his trousers. Below them, the ice sang its thin glass song. The sun was climbing, turning the whole Frostmere into a field of white fire, painful to look at directly.

"That man," Sefiathan said, and then stopped, not sure what he was asking.

"Maren. His wife left three months ago. Might come back. Might not. He keeps showing up here asking me to read the winds, to tell him if she's thinking of him, if she's safe, if she's done with him or just taking time." Orvenna breathed in, slow. "I told him last week that the winds don't carry answers like that. He didn't believe me. People rarely do."

"What do they carry?"

"Movement. Direction. Sometimes warning. Never certainty." She opened one eye, looked at him. "You're thinking about someone."

It wasn't a question. Sefiathan felt his face heat despite the cold. He was thinking about someone — had been, on and off, since last night. Not anyone specific. Just the concept of someone. The possibility. The terror of it.

"I don't know if I could do that," he said. "Love someone like that. Disastrously. Without armor."

"You already do," Orvenna said. "You loved that ugly bird enough to learn your own song. You loved a clearing enough to stay in it healing. You loved your family enough that leaving them nearly tore you apart." She closed her eye again. "You've always loved disastrously. You've just been calling it something else. Weakness. Too much. A flaw to fix."

Sefiathan sat with that. The ice hummed below them. Far off, someone laughed — clear and bright and unguarded.

"The difference," Orvenna continued, "is whether you treat your love like it's evidence of some crime you've committed, or like it's just what you do. A fact. Like breathing."

"What if someone sees it and runs?"

"Then they run. And you keep breathing." She shifted slightly, the first movement she'd made all morning. "The wind doesn't stop blowing because someone closes a door. It finds another way through. Your love isn't contingent on whether anyone receives it well. It just is."

Sefiathan thought about Maren. About his wife who might come back or might not. About standing in front of Orvenna demanding the universe give him certainty, give him closure, give him anything but this terrible hanging unknowing.

He thought about himself, years ago, watching Mira learn carpentry, scanning for flaws in her, calculating risks, comparing her to ghosts of every other person who'd ever been chosen over him. How he'd never just let himself feel what he felt — had always been too busy protecting himself from the feeling to actually feel it.

"I don't know how to love without armor," he said.

"Yes you do. You did it last night when you sang your song. You do it every time you sit here and let your loud thoughts be loud without apologizing for them." Orvenna breathed out, long and steady. "You're just scared that if you do it with a person, they'll have the power to hurt you."

"Won't they?"

"Yes. That's the point. That's the invitation."

Below them, deep in the dark water under the ice, something pulsed — warm and patient and utterly unafraid.

Sefiathan sat with Orvenna in the cold bright morning, terrified, and didn't run.
