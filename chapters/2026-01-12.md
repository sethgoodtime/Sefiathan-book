Day 12: The Open Door

Morning came with mist rising off the stream, turning the forest into something from a dream. Sefiathan woke stiff but rested, the quiet voice from yesterday still present but manageable—background noise rather than a narrator.

He broke camp slowly, taking time to properly bank what remained of his fire, to fold his blanket with care rather than stuffing it haphazardly into his pack. Small actions. Intentional ones. The kind that said he was here, present, paying attention.

The dried meat was gone. He'd finished the last of it last night. His waterskin was full from the stream, but food had become a pressing concern. The foraging he'd managed—watercress, cattail roots, those berries—had supplemented his supplies but couldn't replace them. He'd need to figure something out soon.

He started walking as the mist burned off, following the stream north for the first hour. The water provided direction, and there was something comforting about its constant sound—a reminder that some things just kept moving regardless of whether you were ready or not.

Around mid-morning, the stream curved east and Sefiathan had to make a choice: follow it, or continue north into denser forest. He chose north. The stream would be there if he needed to backtrack, but something pulled him deeper into the Wildlands.

The terrain shifted as he walked—subtle changes at first, then more pronounced. The massive ancient trees gave way occasionally to younger growth, and the understory thickened. More ferns, more flowering plants, occasional clearings where fallen giants had let light in.

He'd been walking perhaps three hours when he came to it: a fork in the path.

Not a dramatic split—just a place where the game trail he'd been following divided into two equally viable routes. Both disappeared into forest within a few dozen paces. No signs, no obvious landmarks, no indication that one choice was better than the other.

Sefiathan stopped, looking first left, then right.

And now: a decision.

His first instinct was to stop and think it through. Weigh the options. Look for clues about which path led north, which might have water nearby, which seemed more traveled. Make an informed choice based on careful analysis.

Sefiathan felt the familiar urge to plan, to research in his mind all the variables, to wait until he was certain he was making the right choice.

Then he thought: fuck it.

He took the left path.

Not because it was the better choice—he had no idea if it was better. Not because he'd carefully weighed pros and cons. Just because the door was open and he was tired of standing in doorways waiting for perfect certainty before walking through them.

The path immediately became more challenging. Steeper terrain, more roots to navigate, places where he had to use his hands to pull himself up small inclines. Within twenty minutes, Sefiathan was breathing hard and questioning his impulsive choice.

But he kept going.

The left path led to a ridge he hadn't known was there. From the top, he could see out over the forest canopy—an ocean of green stretching in all directions, the Thornspire Mountains visible in the far distance, and something he hadn't expected: a cleared area maybe two miles ahead that looked like it might be a settlement.

He never would have seen it from the right path.

Sefiathan stood on the ridge, catching his breath, looking out at the view he'd earned by just choosing instead of deliberating. The settlement probably meant people, which meant he could resupply, ask about the area, maybe get information about what lay further north.

But getting there would require going down the steep side of this ridge and then navigating through dense forest with no clear path. Easy would have been staying on the well-worn trail. Easy would have been taking the right fork that probably stayed level and comfortable.

This way required doing the hard thing.

Sefiathan started down the ridge, moving carefully, using trees and rocks for handholds. Twice he slipped on loose dirt and had to catch himself. Once he startled something—some kind of forest creature—that crashed away through the underbrush with alarmed squeaks.

When he reached the bottom, sweating and slightly scraped up, he had to bushwhack. No path here, just forest. He picked a direction based on where he'd seen the clearing from above and started pushing through ferns and low branches.

It took two hours of difficult navigation to reach the settlement. Two hours when he could have been walking easily on a maintained path. Two hours of scratches and sweat and uncertainty about whether he was even going in the right direction.

But when he finally emerged from the forest into the clearing, he found something worth the effort.

The settlement wasn't a village exactly—more like a trading post. A single large building that looked like it served multiple functions, a few smaller outbuildings, and what appeared to be a stable for horses or pack animals. But most interestingly, there were people from everywhere.

Sefiathan saw what had to be fae—tall and elegant with that otherworldly quality that marked them as not-quite-human. A centaur stood near the stable, talking with a dwarf who barely came up to the centaur's chest. Several humans of various descriptions moved between buildings. And perched on the roof of the main building, something that might have been a small dragon or might have been a very large lizard—Sefiathan couldn't tell from this distance.

A true crossroads of Parogar. The kind of place you only found if you took the hard path.

Sefiathan walked toward the main building, aware that he looked rough—sweaty, scratched, covered in bits of leaves and forest debris. A woman sat on the porch of the main building, smoking a pipe, watching him approach with amused eyes.

"Took the ridge route, did you?" she called when he got close enough.

"How did you know?"

"You're coming from the west, and you look like you wrestled a thornbush and lost. Everyone who comes from the west either takes the easy valley path or the ridge. Valley people show up clean. Ridge people show up looking like you." She grinned. "Most people take the valley."

"Is the ridge route stupid?"

"Depends on what you value. It's harder, takes longer, more chance of getting lost. But you see things from up there you'd never see from the valley. And you end up here, which is something." She gestured to the settlement. "I'm Maren. This is the Crossroads Post. You need supplies? Food? A bed that's not dirt?"

"All of those things," Sefiathan admitted.

"Well, come on then. First ale's free for ridge walkers—call it a reward for taking the interesting path."

The Crossroads Post was exactly what it looked like from outside: a trading hub where people from all over Parogar came to exchange goods, share information, and rest before continuing their journeys. The main room had a bar on one side, tables scattered throughout, and a noticeboard covered in messages, requests, and warnings.

Maren poured him an ale—dark and bitter and exactly what he needed—and pointed to a back corner where he could stow his pack. Sefiathan drank half the ale in one long pull, then went to the noticeboard to read while he finished it.

Most of the notices were practical: requests for traveling companions heading south, warnings about flooding in the eastern territories, a bounty on some creature called a "razorwing" that had been attacking livestock. But one notice caught his eye:

*Seeking those with undiscovered abilities. The Temple of Becoming offers guidance for late bloomers, the unlabeled, and the undefined. Three days north, follow the river. -Sister Venn*

Sefiathan read it three times.

Late bloomers. The unlabeled. The undefined.

That was—him. Exactly him. Someone at this temple apparently specialized in people who hadn't figured out their power or purpose yet. This could be the answer he'd left home looking for.

He could go there. Three days north, follow the river. Easy to find. He could get supplies here, get directions, make a plan to reach the temple and finally get some answers about what he was supposed to be.

Or—

Or he could keep walking his own path. Keep figuring things out through experience rather than instruction. Keep taking the hard route because it showed him things the easy route never would.

Sefiathan stood in front of the noticeboard, holding his half-finished ale, feeling the weight of the choice.

This was the door open right now. The temple was there, offering exactly what he thought he wanted. All he had to do was walk through it.

But something in him hesitated.

He'd been waiting his whole life for someone to tell him what he was, what he should do, how to unlock whatever potential might be hiding inside him. And maybe the Temple of Becoming could do that. Maybe Sister Venn had answers.

Or maybe—

Maybe the journey was teaching him something that no temple could. Maybe stumbling through the Wildlands, making mistakes, learning from forests and strangers and his own body's rebellion, was exactly what he needed. Not easy. Not comfortable. But real.

Sefiathan finished his ale and walked back to Maren at the bar.

"The Temple of Becoming," he said. "You know anything about it?"

"Sure. Sister Venn runs it. Good people. They help folks figure out their abilities, find their path. You thinking of going?"

"Maybe. I don't know. What do you think—is it worth it?"

Maren studied him with those amused eyes. "That's not a question I can answer. Some people need a teacher. Some people need to figure it out themselves. You strike me as someone who's been waiting for permission your whole life." She refilled his ale without him asking. "Question is: you ready to keep waiting, or you ready to just—do something?"

Sefiathan picked up the fresh ale, considering.

The temple was easy. It was research. It was planning. It was waiting for someone else to tell him he was ready.

The Wildlands were hard. They required doing it before he felt ready. Required walking through open doors without knowing what was on the other side.

He drank, thinking about the left path, the ridge route, the two hours of bushwhacking to get here. None of it had been easy. All of it had been exactly right.

"I'm going to keep heading north," he said finally. "Not to the temple. Just—north. Into the deeper Wildlands."

Maren grinned. "Ridge walker through and through. All right then. You'll need better supplies than what you've got. I'll set you up with real provisions—dried fruit, hardtack, some salted fish. And you'll want a better blade than that little knife you're carrying."

She spent the next hour outfitting him properly. Showed him which plants were edible in the northern Wildlands, which ones would kill him. Gave him a small guidebook written by someone who'd mapped the area. Sold him a hunting knife that could actually handle the work he'd been trying to do with his father's small blade.

It cost him almost everything—the few coins he had left plus Lyrei's piece of glass, which Maren accepted with understanding. "I'll make sure it gets to someone who needs it," she promised.

By the time Sefiathan left the Crossroads Post, the sun was setting. He made camp just outside the settlement, in a spot Maren had recommended. And as he settled in for the night—better supplied, better equipped, and somehow more certain than he'd been in weeks—he thought about doors.

The temple had been a door. But so was the path ahead. So was every choice he'd made since leaving Millhaven.

The difference was: he'd stopped waiting for someone to tell him which door to walk through. He'd stopped researching and planning and waiting for perfect certainty.

He'd just—chosen. And then dealt with whatever came next.

His melody came to him as he drifted toward sleep, and tonight it had something new: a sense of momentum. Of movement. Of walking through doors instead of standing in them.

Still incomplete. Still searching. But god, it felt good to finally be moving.
