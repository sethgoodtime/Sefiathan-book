Day 31 - January 31, 2026
The path grew steeper as they climbed into proper mountain country. Pine trees gave way to hardier vegetation—scrub brush, tough grasses, patches of lichen on exposed rock. The air thinned slightly, each breath requiring more attention.
Sefiathan's mind kept circling back to his father.
Not the whole constellation of family hurt—just his father specifically. The way he'd looked at Sefiathan the day before he left. That particular expression of resigned disappointment, like he'd long ago given up expecting anything different.
"You'll never finish what you start," his father had said. Not angry, just—factual. The way you'd comment on weather or the quality of wood grain. "You get excited about things and then you lose interest. It's who you are."
Sefiathan had carried that moment for weeks now. Polished it in his mind until it gleamed with significance. Built elaborate arguments against it—I'm on this journey, aren't I? I'm walking to the Frostmere. I finished my melody. See? I can finish things.
But underneath the arguments, the grievance festered. His father had wronged him. Had judged him unfairly. Had reduced twenty-seven years of trying to a single character flaw.
They stopped to rest at a rocky outcrop that offered a view back the way they'd come. Hills rolling away into distance, the meadowlands where the Singing Stones stood somewhere beyond sight. A week of walking visible in landscape.
Korrin pulled out dried fruit, offered some to Sefiathan. They chewed in silence for a while, catching their breath from the climb.
"You're carrying something heavy today," Korrin observed.
"My father." Sefiathan picked at the rock beside him, flaking off bits of lichen. "Thinking about what he said before I left. About me never finishing things."
"Was he wrong?"
The question surprised him. He'd expected sympathy, validation that his father had been unfair.
"I—I don't know. Maybe not completely wrong. But—"
"But you wanted him to see you differently?" Korrin stretched their legs, all four of them, working out the climb. "Wanted him to notice the things you had finished instead of cataloging the things you hadn't?"
"Yeah."
"And now you're carrying that. Nursing it. Keeping the grievance fresh so you don't forget how he wronged you."
Sefiathan felt something prickle defensively in his chest. "He did wrong me. He reduced me to—"
"Maybe." Korrin looked out at the view. "Probably. But what are you doing with it? The hurt from yesterday was just hurt—present, real, something to feel. This is different. This is keeping a record. Building a case. Making sure you remember every detail of the crime."
"So I should just forget it? Pretend it didn't hurt?"
"No. But there's a difference between feeling hurt and feeding grievance." Korrin turned to look at him directly. "Grievance needs fuel. You have to keep adding to it, keep remembering, keep rehearsing the offense. Otherwise it—" They made a gesture like something dissipating. "It just becomes part of the past. Something that happened."
Sefiathan sat with that. The way he'd been replaying his father's words, adding context, building the narrative of unfairness. Memorizing every detail like evidence for a trial that would never happen.
"I don't know how to let it go," he said quietly.
"You don't let it go. You stop feeding it." Korrin finished their fruit, tucked the wrapping back in their pack. "Stop adding fuel. Stop rehearsing. Let the fire burn down on its own."
They resumed climbing. The path switchbacked up the hillside, gaining elevation with each turn. Sefiathan's legs burned with the effort, but it felt good—clean pain, just muscles doing work.
He thought about his burn book. Not a literal book, but the mental catalog he kept. Every slight, every dismissal, every moment of being underestimated or overlooked or reduced to less than he was. His father's comment was just the newest entry in a long ledger.
What would it mean to burn that book? To stop adding entries, stop reviewing old ones, stop keeping such careful track of who had wronged him and how?
Around midday they reached a plateau where the terrain flattened briefly before continuing upward. A small stream cut through the rock here, creating a pool where water collected before spilling over and continuing down. They stopped to refill water and rest properly.
"My cousin kept a list," Korrin said, settling onto a flat rock near the pool. "Everyone who'd hurt them. Everything anyone had ever said that was dismissive or cruel or thoughtless. They'd review it sometimes, make sure they remembered. Said it helped them know who not to trust."
"Did it help?"
"It kept them trapped." Korrin watched water move across the pool's surface. "They couldn't make new friends because they were too busy remembering old hurts. Couldn't trust anyone new because the list proved people couldn't be trusted. The burn book became their whole relationship to the world."
"Is that what you fought about?"
"Part of it. I wanted them to burn it. They said that was the same as saying their pain didn't matter, that people should get away with hurting them." Korrin picked up a small stone, turned it over in their hands. "And maybe they were right. Maybe I was asking them to forgive too easily. But—I don't know. Watching them nurse those grievances, watching them get smaller and more defended and more certain everyone was an enemy—it felt like the burn book was doing more damage than the original hurts."
Sefiathan drank from his refilled waterskin, the cold water sharp and clean. He thought about his own list. The casual cruelties, the thoughtless dismissals, the moments of being made to feel small or strange or insufficient.
His father saying he'd never finish things.
His mother's loving disappointment.
His sister's easy competence that made his struggles look like character flaws.
The teacher in his childhood who'd called him lazy when he was actually confused.
The friend who'd laughed at his melody before he learned to keep it to himself.
The village elder who'd suggested maybe he wasn't meant for magic, said it kindly, like a comfort.
All of it cataloged. All of it feeding a grievance that kept him defended, certain, justified in his isolation.
"The people who hurt me," Sefiathan said slowly. "Most of them probably don't remember. Don't carry it the way I do."
"Probably not."
"So I'm the only one still holding it. Still adding fuel. Still burning."
"Yeah."
The pool reflected sky—blue and white clouds moving across its surface. Sefiathan watched his reflection waver in the water. Distorted but recognizable.
"I don't know who I am without the grievances," he admitted. "They've been—they've been how I understood myself. The wronged one. The underestimated one. The one who was never given a fair chance."
"And with them?"
"With them, I'm—I don't know. Just someone who got hurt sometimes and is trying to figure out how to be alive anyway."
Korrin tossed the stone they'd been holding into the pool. It sank quickly, disappearing into dark water. "That sounds freer."
They rested a while longer, then continued climbing. The path grew rockier, requiring more attention to footing. Sefiathan focused on the immediate—where to step, how to balance, the rhythm of upward movement.
But underneath, he was testing something. What if he stopped rehearsing his father's words? Stopped adding context and evidence and proof of unfairness? Just—let it be something that happened, one thing among many things, not the defining moment of their relationship?
It felt dangerous. Like losing his justification for leaving. Like admitting maybe he'd overreacted, maybe he was too sensitive, maybe—
No. That was the trap. Burning the burn book didn't mean deciding he hadn't been hurt. Just meant stopping the active nursing of it. Letting it become past instead of present-continuous.
By late afternoon they'd reached a higher elevation where the vegetation thinned to almost nothing. Exposed rock, hardy moss, the occasional stubborn plant clinging to crevices. The Thornspire Mountains were close now—their peaks sharp and snow-covered, dominating the northern horizon.
They made camp in the lee of a boulder that blocked the wind. The air had real bite at this elevation, and they built a larger fire than usual. Korrin produced a small pot and started making something that smelled of herbs and the dried meat they'd bought in the village.
"When you see your cousin," Sefiathan asked, watching the fire, "are you going to bring up the fight?"
"I don't know. Part of me wants to explain, to defend myself, to make sure they know I wasn't trying to—" Korrin stirred the pot. "But that's just my own burn book talking. My catalog of being misunderstood."
"So what will you do?"
"Show up. Be present. See who they are now instead of rehearsing who they were then." Korrin looked up from the pot. "Maybe that's all forgiveness is. Not deciding the hurt didn't happen, but deciding to stop adding fuel to it."
They ate together as darkness fell and stars appeared. The soup was good—warming from the inside out. Sefiathan thought about his burn book, thick with entries, carefully maintained.
What would it feel like to just—stop? Stop reviewing it, stop adding to it, stop using it as evidence for why he couldn't trust or connect or risk being hurt again?
Terrifying. Liberating. Both at once.
After eating, Sefiathan pulled out a small piece of bark he'd picked up earlier. Smooth and dry. He held it over the fire for a moment, then pulled it back.
"What are you doing?" Korrin asked.
"Thinking about burning something." He studied the bark—just a piece of tree, nothing special. "But actual burning feels too—I don't know. Symbolic? Performative?"
"The burn book isn't literal anyway. It's just—stopping. Choosing not to feed it."
Sefiathan set the bark aside. Korrin was right. He didn't need ritual or ceremony. Just a decision, repeated daily, to stop rehearsing grievances. Stop keeping such careful records of who had wronged him.
His father had said that thing about never finishing. It had hurt. That was real.
And also real: Sefiathan was here, walking to the Frostmere, thirty-one days into a journey he hadn't abandoned. His father's words were his father's words. They didn't have to be prophecy or proof or permanent truth.
They could just be—something that was said once, that hurt, that existed now in the past.
The fire crackled. Wind moved across the exposed rock around them, making sounds like distant voices. And Sefiathan felt something loosen in his chest. Not forgiveness exactly—he wasn't ready to call it that. Just—less fuel. Less active burning.
His melody hummed in his chest, and tonight it had a quality of letting go. Not dramatic release, just—the slow exhale after holding your breath too long. The quiet relief of setting down something heavy.
Tomorrow the grievances might flare up again. Probably would. But tonight, he'd stopped feeding them. Had let the fire burn lower.
That was enough.
More than enough.
It was freedom starting to happen in the smallest, quietest way.Feb 4
