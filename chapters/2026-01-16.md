Day 16: Just Start

Sefiathan woke on his fourth morning in the clearing and immediately knew something was different about today. Not about the clearing—that was the same. Not about his ankle—still swollen, still needed rest. Different about him.

He had work to do.

Not the kind he'd been doing—tending camp, foraging, soaking his ankle. Real work. The kind he'd been avoiding since leaving Millhaven because it felt too big, too uncertain, too likely to confirm he was exactly as inadequate as he feared.

His melody. The song that had been incomplete since the ugly bird first sang it into existence fifteen days ago.

Sefiathan had been humming fragments, adding phrases here and there, letting it build gradually. But he'd never actually tried to complete it. Never sat down and done the work of finishing something that mattered. Because finishing meant it could be judged. Finished meant it could fail to be good enough.

Better to keep it incomplete. Keep it safe in potential.

But sitting there in the clearing, ankle throbbing, nowhere to go for weeks—the excuses ran out. The careful preparation that had been elaborate stalling revealed itself for what it was. He could spend another month thinking about the melody, planning it, waiting for the perfect moment of inspiration.

Or he could just start.

Sefiathan made tea first. Not procrastinating—the guidance had been specific about that. Make yourself tea, put on some music, and just get it done. He boiled water over the fire, added the sharp-smelling leaves he'd found, let it steep properly.

Music was harder. He had no instruments, no way to play anything except his own voice. But as he sat there drinking tea, he realized the clearing had its own music: the stream's constant murmur, wind moving through branches high overhead, the occasional bird call, the crackle of his fire.

Good enough.

Sefiathan pulled out his journal and turned to a fresh page. Not to write words—to write music. He sketched a rough staff, marked where he thought the melody started. Then he just—began.

The first phrase came easily. It was the ugly bird's song, the one that had started everything. He hummed it aloud, writing it down, feeling how it wanted to move.

The second phrase fought him. He tried three different versions, crossing them out, starting again. His hand cramped. The tea got cold. The voice in his head provided helpful commentary about how he was wasting time, how this was stupid, how he didn't know enough about music to be doing this.

He kept going anyway.

By midday, Sefiathan had maybe thirty seconds of melody sketched out. It wasn't good. Parts of it didn't flow right. The transitions were clunky. But it was there—on paper, real, no longer just fragments in his head.

He took a break to eat, to soak his ankle, to add wood to the fire. Then he came back to it.

The afternoon was brutal. Every phrase felt wrong. The melody wanted to go directions he couldn't quite hear. He'd get something that felt right, then realize it didn't connect to what came before. He filled pages with crossed-out attempts, false starts, ideas that went nowhere.

But he didn't stop. Didn't wait for inspiration or the perfect moment or for it to get easier. Just kept working, kept trying, kept pushing through the part where it was hard and felt impossible and he wanted to quit.

The work won't feel as hard once you're ten minutes in, the guidance had said. Start now. The momentum will carry you.

It was true. After the first hour of grinding through resistance, something shifted. Sefiathan stopped thinking so much and started feeling. Stopped trying to make it perfect and started following where the melody wanted to go. The music of the clearing—stream and wind and fire—began to inform the song, adding elements he wouldn't have thought of on his own.

By evening, he had something. Not complete—maybe a minute and a half of melody, rough and imperfect. But it was more than he'd ever had before. It was progress. It was real work, done.

Sefiathan sat by the fire as darkness fell, humming what he'd created. It was still incomplete. Still had gaps and rough transitions. But it was no longer just potential. It was actual.

He'd started. And the starting was the hardest part.

Over the next few days, the pattern repeated. Wake up, make tea, work on the melody. Fight through resistance, push past the voice saying it wasn't good enough, keep going even when it felt impossible. Break for meals and ankle care, then come back to it.

Some days he added thirty seconds. Some days he spent hours on a single transition that still didn't feel right. Some days he went backwards, crossing out entire sections and starting over.

But every day, he worked. No more elaborate stalling. No more waiting for perfect conditions or inspiration or for the moment when it would feel easy.

Just: make tea, tend the fire, do the work.

On the seventh day in the clearing, Sefiathan realized his ankle was significantly better. Still tender, but the swelling had gone down. He could put weight on it without sharp pain. He could probably start walking again in another day or two.

And his melody was maybe two-thirds complete.

He sat with that information, feeling something settle in his chest. He could leave the clearing soon. Continue north, keep moving. But the melody wasn't done yet. And for the first time in his life, Sefiathan realized he wanted to finish something more than he wanted to move on to the next thing.

So he stayed.

Not because he had to—his ankle would support travel now. But because the work mattered. Because finishing something, really finishing it rather than keeping it safe in incomplete potential, felt important in a way he couldn't fully articulate.

The clearing held him while he worked. The Deepwood was patient. And Sefiathan learned what it felt like to commit to completing something difficult, not because it was easy or comfortable or guaranteed to be good, but because it was his.

On the tenth day in the clearing, just as the sun was setting and painting the canopy in gold and orange, Sefiathan hummed the last phrase of his melody. It connected to the beginning, creating a complete circle. The song was done.

It wasn't perfect. Parts of it were still clunky. The middle section had a transition he'd never quite solved. But it was complete. It was finished. It existed as a whole thing rather than fragments.

He hummed it again, start to finish, letting the melody fill the clearing. The stream provided harmony. The wind added rhythm. The fire crackled accompaniment.

And for the first time since hearing the ugly bird sing fifteen days ago, Sefiathan felt like he'd created something that was entirely his own. Not inherited from his mother's magic or his father's craft or his sister's competence. Just—his.

The song of someone learning to fly despite having all the wrong parts. The song of taking time to heal. The song of showing up consistently, day after day, doing the work even when it was hard.

His song.

Sefiathan pulled out the carved bird—finally finished as well, after days of work—and set it on a rock where it could catch the last light. The bird looked ridiculous. Lopsided and ungainly and definitely not aerodynamic.

But it had wings spread, ready for flight. And if you listened closely, you could almost hear it singing.

Tomorrow, he'd leave the clearing. His ankle was healed enough. His work was done. The Deepwood called him deeper, and he was ready to answer.

But tonight, he sat by his fire in the clearing that had held him while he mended, and he hummed his completed melody into the gathering dark. Imperfect and entirely his own.

It was enough.
