Day 38 — February 7, 2026

He dreamed of Mira.

Not the Mira who'd worked alongside his father, learning joints and grain while Sefiathan watched from doorways. Not the Mira he'd built into a symbol of everything he wasn't — capable, chosen, belonging. The Mira in the dream was just a girl sitting on a fence, eating an apple, and when he walked up to her she said, "Oh, are you still here? I thought you left."

"I did leave," he told her.

"No," she said. "You left the building. You've been standing in the yard this whole time."

He woke with his heart hammering and the taste of something sharp and green in his mouth, like he'd bitten into unripe fruit. The tent was cold. Outside, voices carried across the Frostmere — morning sounds, someone chopping wood, the clatter of tin cups.

The dream stayed with him through breakfast, through a conversation with Tavis about the route south they'd eventually need to take, through a walk along the frozen marsh where the ice had begun to sing in the warming air — high, thin notes like a finger circling the rim of a glass. He kept turning it over. *You've been standing in the yard this whole time.*

He'd thought leaving Millhaven was the brave act. The departure, the road, the reinvention. But maybe he'd only moved his body. His attention — that restless, hungry, too-much attention that made people uncomfortable and made him feel like a burden — had stayed fixed on the same old wounds. The father who didn't see him. The apprentice who replaced him. The version of himself who'd never been enough.

He was still watching the house from the yard, waiting for someone to come to the window and call him back in.

Calantha was by the communal washing station, scrubbing a pot with sand and not looking at anyone. He sat down nearby and started on his own cup, not because he had anything to say but because he wanted to be near someone without it meaning something. She glanced at him once, acknowledged his presence with a nod, and went back to scrubbing.

After a while she said, "There's a woman here named Orvenna. She reads the deep winds — the ones that come up from underground, through the ice. She's difficult. Talks in circles. Smells like wet stone." A pause. "She's the best teacher at this gathering and she only takes students who ask her directly, because she got tired of people who showed up out of obligation."

"Is this advice?"

"It's information. Do what you want with it."

Sefiathan finished his cup. The metal was dented and the handle had been resoldered at least twice, but it was clean now, and it was his, borrowed from the communal supply without guilt because he needed a cup and needing a cup was not a moral failing.

He found Orvenna by following the smell — Calantha hadn't been wrong about the wet stone. She was sitting at the very edge of the Frostmere itself, on a slab of granite that jutted over the ice like a pulpit, her legs folded beneath her, her grey hair unbound and moving in a wind Sefiathan couldn't feel. She was perhaps sixty. Perhaps older. She had the kind of face that looked like it had been left out in weather until all the softness was gone and only the essential architecture remained.

"I'd like to learn from you," he said. No preamble. No apology for interrupting. No elaborate justification for why he deserved her time.

Orvenna didn't open her eyes. "Why?"

"Because I pay attention to things in a way that most people find too intense, and I want to learn what that's for instead of spending another year apologizing for it."

One eye opened. Grey as the ice. "Hmm," she said. "Sit down. Don't talk. Listen to what the ground is saying."

He sat. He didn't talk. Below them, deep beneath the frozen marsh, something hummed — not a sound exactly, but a vibration, a pressure, like the earth itself was holding a long, low note and waiting for someone to notice.

Sefiathan noticed.

And far below, in the dark water under the ice, something that had been sleeping for a very long time stirred — just slightly, just enough — and turned toward the warmth of his attention like a root toward sun.
