Day 14: Where You Need to Be

The stream led west, just as Maren had said it would. Sefiathan followed it through the afternoon and into evening, watching the forest change around him. The trees grew larger again, older, their trunks so thick he couldn't have wrapped his arms around them even if he'd brought ten friends. The canopy thickened, filtering sunlight into a green-gold dimness that made it feel later than it was.

He made camp that night near a bend in the stream where the water pooled into something almost pond-like. The spot felt right—sheltered by a massive cedar, flat ground for sleeping, easy water access. He built a fire properly, using the techniques that were becoming second nature now, and prepared a real meal: dried fish rehydrated in stream water, hardtack softened in the same pot, dried fruit for after.

It wasn't fancy, but it was competent. He was getting good at this. The realization settled in his chest with quiet satisfaction—not pride exactly, but acknowledgment. He was surviving alone in the Wildlands. That was—something.

After eating, Sefiathan sat by the fire and watched the light fade. The dissatisfaction came right on schedule.

It started as a low-level buzz in the back of his mind, then grew louder: *This isn't enough. You should be further along by now. Two weeks in the forest and what have you learned? How to make a fire? How to not starve? That's basic survival, not transformation. You left home to find your purpose and instead you're just—walking. Eating. Sleeping. What's the point?*

He recognized it immediately as the voice from Day Eleven, just dressed in different clothes. Not harsh criticism this time, but dissatisfaction. The sense that wherever he was, whatever he was doing, it should be something else. Something more.

*Should have taken the valley path. Should have gone to the temple. Should be making better progress, should have figured something out by now, should be—*

Sefiathan cut off the spiral by focusing on what was actually around him. The fire burning steady. The stream making its constant music. The cedar tree solid at his back. His belly full. His body tired in the good way that came from a full day of walking. His knee doing fine.

This life he'd built—even just for today—actually worked.

He hadn't planned it perfectly. Hadn't researched the optimal route or prepared for every contingency. He'd just—made decisions and dealt with what came. And he was alive, fed, warm, safe. The dissatisfaction was just his mind doing what it always did: telling him that present reality wasn't enough, that he should be somewhere else, someone else, something more.

But what if this was exactly where he needed to be?

Sefiathan pulled out the hunting knife Maren had sold him and a piece of wood he'd picked up earlier—not for any reason, just because the grain had looked interesting. He started whittling, not trying to make anything specific, just letting his hands work while his mind settled.

The knife was sharp, well-balanced. Each cut removed a thin curl of wood that fell into the fire or onto the ground beside him. He wasn't skilled at this—his father had never taught him carving, just joinery—but it felt good to do something with his hands that wasn't about survival or progress or purpose.

Just—making something. For no reason except that he wanted to.

An hour passed. The wood in his hands started to look like something, though he wasn't sure what. Maybe a bird. Maybe just an interesting shape. It didn't matter. He was here, doing this, and it was enough.

When his hands got tired, Sefiathan put the knife and half-carved wood aside and lay back against his pack, looking up at what little sky he could see through the canopy. Stars were starting to appear, though the dense trees blocked most of them.

He thought about the choices that had led him here: leaving Millhaven, meeting Torval and Mikken and Lyrei, walking north instead of east, taking the left path at the fork, climbing the ridge instead of taking the valley, choosing to leave the Crossroads Post instead of staying, choosing to follow this particular stream west.

Each choice had felt uncertain at the time. Each one had invited second-guessing and doubt. But strung together, they'd brought him here—to this spot by this stream under this cedar tree, alive and learning and slowly becoming someone who didn't need permission to exist.

The dissatisfaction tried one more time: *But what have you actually accomplished?*

Sefiathan smiled at the fire. "I'm here," he said aloud. "That's the accomplishment."

The voice had no response to that.

He fed the fire one more time, banked it properly for the night, and settled into his blanket. Sleep came easily, his body tired from walking, his mind quieter than it had been in years.

In his dreams, he was carving something—not the piece of wood from tonight, but something larger, more complex. He couldn't see what it was, just knew that each cut mattered, each choice shaped the final form, and that rushing wouldn't make it come out right. You just had to keep working, trust the process, let the shape reveal itself gradually.

When he woke the next morning, the half-carved wood was still sitting where he'd left it. In daylight it definitely looked like a bird—ugly, lopsided, wings at wrong angles. But singing anyway, if you knew how to hear it.

Sefiathan picked it up, ran his thumb over the rough surface, and smiled. Then he tucked it into his pack next to the water-stained journal and Mikken's ridiculous handkerchief that he'd somehow gotten back from Maren without noticing.

Wait—no. Maren had taken the handkerchief for breakfast. He'd watched her fold it and put it in her pocket. So how was it back in his pack?

He pulled it out, examined it. Same dancing chicken, same ridiculous embroidery. But pinned to it with a small wooden pin was a note in handwriting he didn't recognize:

*Some gifts are meant to keep traveling. Pass it forward when the time's right. -M*

Maren must have slipped it back into his pack when he wasn't looking. Another small kindness, another act of showing up, another reminder that people cared in ways you didn't always notice until later.

Sefiathan refolded the handkerchief carefully and put it back in his pack. Someday he'd pass it forward. When he met someone who needed a ridiculous dancing chicken to remind them that life didn't always have to be serious.

He broke camp efficiently, ate a quick breakfast of dried fruit and water, and continued following the stream west. The forest grew even denser, the old growth so thick that paths were just suggestions. This was the Deepwood proper, he realized—the place Maren had mentioned where wilderness was still wild.

By midday, Sefiathan found himself in a grove of trees so ancient they felt like cathedrals. The trunks rose straight up for what must have been a hundred feet before the first branches appeared. The forest floor was carpeted in moss so thick it felt like walking on clouds. Everything was green and gold and silent except for the distant sound of water.

This was exactly where he needed to be.

Not because it was special or magical or would teach him some important lesson. Just because it was beautiful, and he was here to see it, and that was enough.

Sefiathan sat down in the moss, back against one of the ancient trunks, and just—existed. No agenda. No should-be-doing. Just present.

The dissatisfaction tried to creep in, tried to tell him he was wasting time, but he acknowledged it and let it pass like clouds across sky. His mind wanted him to be somewhere else, but his body was here, in this moment, in this grove.

And this moment was enough.

After a while—he couldn't say how long—Sefiathan stood and kept walking. The stream would lead him wherever it led him. He'd make decisions when decisions needed making. He'd camp when night came. He'd eat when hungry, rest when tired, keep moving forward not because he had to but because that's what felt right.

Two weeks ago he'd left home desperate to find his purpose. Now he was learning that maybe purpose wasn't something you found—it was something you built, one small choice at a time, one day at a time, one moment of being exactly where you were without wishing you were somewhere else.

His melody came to him as he walked, and today it had a quality of contentment. Still incomplete, still searching, but okay with the incompleteness. Okay with not having all the answers. Okay with being in the middle of the story instead of at the end.

The Deepwood stretched ahead, ancient and patient, and Sefiathan walked into it without needing to know what came next.

He was already exactly where he needed to be.
