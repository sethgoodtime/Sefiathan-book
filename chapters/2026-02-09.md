**Day 40 — February 9, 2026**

Sefiathan woke knowing he was going to do something stupid.

Not dangerous-stupid. Not run-into-the-Wildlands-without-supplies stupid. Just the kind of stupid that meant showing up as himself in a room full of people who might not like what they saw. The kind his whole life had been structured around avoiding.

There was a gathering that evening — not formal like the sharing circle, just people collecting around the main fire after dinner to talk, tell stories, play instruments if they had them. He'd watched from the edges the past few nights, close enough to feel included, far enough to slip away unnoticed. His usual position. The gallery seat.

But yesterday, sitting with Orvenna, something had shifted. Not dramatically. He hadn't suddenly become a different person. But he'd noticed — really noticed — how much energy it took to constantly modulate himself, to sand down his edges, to translate his intensity into something more palatable before letting it out into the world.

And he was tired. Tired of rehearsing. Tired of stage whispers. Tired of trying to win over people who fundamentally misunderstood him by becoming someone they might understand instead.

At breakfast, Korrin asked if he'd be at the fire tonight and Sefiathan said yes before he could stop himself. Korrin's eyebrows rose slightly — not judgment, just surprise — and then he nodded and went back to his porridge. Tavis, oblivious to subtext as always, launched into an explanation of a constellation he'd learned about from one of the elder wind-readers, and Sefiathan half-listened while fighting the urge to take back the yes, to qualify it, to build in an escape route.

He didn't. The yes stood.

The day dragged. He sat with Orvenna again in the morning, and this time when his mind started spinning its usual elaborate anxieties about the evening — who would be there, what he might say, how he might be too much or not enough — he just watched it happen. Didn't try to fix it. Didn't perform calm. Just noticed: *oh, I'm nervous. Oh, I'm already writing scripts for conversations that haven't happened. Oh, I'm doing the thing again.*

Orvenna didn't comment. But at one point she said, without opening her eyes, "The wind doesn't ask permission to blow."

Which could have meant anything or nothing, but Sefiathan chose to let it mean: you're allowed to take up space.

Evening came cold and clear. Stars already visible in the darkening sky, bright and indifferent. The fire had been built up large, crackling, sending sparks toward the constellations like it was trying to join them. Maybe thirty people gathered around it, some he recognized, some he didn't. Calantha was there, carving something from a piece of pale wood. Korrin and Tavis sat together, Tavis gesturing enthusiastically about something while Korrin nodded with infinite patience.

Sefiathan walked up and sat down in the circle. Not at the edge. Not in a position he could easily slip away from. Just sat down, cross-legged, close enough to the fire to feel its heat.

No one stared. No one demanded he justify his presence. A woman across the circle smiled at him briefly and went back to her conversation. That was it. He was just there, and that was allowed.

Someone started playing a dulcimer — not expertly, but with a kind of unself-conscious joy that made the mistakes part of the music. A man told a story about a merchant who tried to sell the same horse three times to the same buyer by dyeing it different colors. People laughed. Someone else added a verse to the story, and it became a game, each person adding a more ridiculous detail until the horse was supposedly capable of flight and poetry and making excellent bread.

Sefiathan listened. Didn't perform listening. Just listened. And something in him relaxed — not all the way, not completely, but enough that when Calantha asked him how his studies with Orvenna were going, he didn't minimize or deflect. He just said: "I'm learning that being loud and being present aren't opposites."

She considered that. "Huh," she said. "Yeah."

Later, someone asked if anyone else had a story, and Sefiathan — without thinking, without rehearsing, without building an escape route — said: "I have a song. It's not very good. But it's mine."

A few people turned toward him. Not demanding. Just listening.

So he sang it. The melody he'd ground out in that clearing weeks ago, the words he'd written without editing. His voice cracked in places. He forgot a line and had to backtrack. It was messy. It was imperfect. It was exactly what it was.

When he finished, there was a pause — not awkward, just a breath — and then someone said, "I liked the part about the light," and someone else hummed a few bars back to him, trying to remember it, and that was it. The circle moved on. He hadn't won anyone over. He hadn't needed to.

Walking back to the tent later, Tavis caught up to him. "That took courage," he said.

"It was just a song."

"No," Tavis said. "It was you, without apology. That's different."

Sefiathan lay in his bedroll that night and thought about all the people in his life he'd tried to win over by becoming smaller, quieter, less. His father. Mira. Half of Millhaven. He'd been so busy trying to translate himself into something they could love that he'd never stopped to ask: what if the discomfort wasn't a flaw in him? What if some people were just never going to get it, and that was fine, and he could stop auditioning?

Under the ice, far below, that deep humming presence pulsed — steady, unbothered, entirely itself.

Sefiathan closed his eyes and let himself be loud in the dark.
