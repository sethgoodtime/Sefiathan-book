**Day 48 — February 17, 2026**

Sefiathan woke to the sound of Tavis arguing with someone outside his tent. Not the heated kind of arguing—more like Tavis was trying to explain something complex and the other person kept interrupting with questions. He recognized the rhythm of it. Tavis building toward a point, getting derailed, starting over with increasing frustration.

He should probably get up. Should probably intervene or at least bear witness. But instead he lay there, listening to the familiar pattern of Tavis trying to communicate and someone else not quite hearing him. It reminded him of watching his father and Mira work together—that same dynamic of one person trying to be understood and the other person hearing something completely different.

Eventually the voices moved away. Sefiathan continued lying there, not quite ready to face the day. Not exhausted like two days ago. Just reluctant. Like his body knew something his mind hadn't caught up to yet.

When he finally emerged, the gathering was in full activity. People clustered around fires, voices carrying across the frozen expanse. Korrin was nowhere visible—probably off doing whatever centaurs did when they needed solitude. Calantha waved from her fire but didn't call him over. Permission to be alone if he wanted it.

He wanted it.

He walked to where the gathering ended and the true Frostmere began—that stretch of frozen marsh that extended north into nothing. The wind was bitter, cutting through his cloak like it was looking for skin. He pulled the fabric tighter and kept walking until the voices behind him became distant texture rather than distinct words.

Out here, alone, he could stop performing. Could let his face settle into whatever expression it wanted instead of managing it for witnesses. Could stop being the sincere transparent boy who wore everything on his face—Calantha's words still sitting in his chest like stones. Not cruel words. Accurate ones. Which somehow made them worse.

He'd spent his whole life being told he was too much. Too intense, too sensitive, too openly affected by things. And now he was here, being told he was transparent, sincere, obvious. Different words for the same basic problem: he couldn't hide what he felt. Couldn't perform neutrality or mystery or the kind of controlled presence other people seemed to manage effortlessly.

His father could walk into a room and you'd have no idea what he was thinking. Could work beside you for hours without revealing a single internal state. Sefiathan showed up and everyone immediately knew if he was hurt, fascinated, frustrated, delighted. Everything written across his face like a book he couldn't close.

The wind bit at his exposed skin. He walked further, boots crunching on frozen ground.

When had performing strength become his default? When had he decided that hiding hurt was the same as being strong? Somewhere between childhood and now, he'd absorbed the lesson that vulnerability was weakness. That letting people see you hurting was giving them power over you. That the armor of jokes and bright smiles and quick deflection was what kept you safe.

Except it hadn't kept him safe. It had just kept him alone.

He thought about yesterday with Calantha, how she'd asked what he was looking for and he'd said permission. Permission to be himself without apology. But what was himself? The transparent boy who couldn't hide his feelings? Or the one who tried to hide them behind performance, who smiled through hurt and joked through pain because showing the truth felt too dangerous?

Both, probably. Both versions trying to coexist in the same body, pulling in opposite directions.

The landscape ahead was featureless—just white and grey and the suggestion of horizon. No landmarks. No variation. Just empty space that went on forever. It should have felt desolate. Instead it felt restful. Nothing demanding his attention. Nothing requiring him to be anything except present.

He sat down on the frozen ground, not caring that the cold would seep through his clothes. Let it. Let his body feel something real and immediate instead of the constant background noise of emotional management.

Someone sees through your act, the reading had said. They know you're hurting despite the bright smile and quick jokes.

The thing was, he wanted someone to see through it. Wanted someone to look past the performance and recognize the hurt underneath. But he also desperately needed the performance to work. Needed people to believe the bright smile, to laugh at the quick jokes, to not see how much effort it took to keep presenting as fine.

Because if the performance failed—if people saw through it—then what? Then they'd know. They'd know he was hurt and still hurting and maybe always hurting in some low-grade way that never quite resolved. They'd know the jokes were armor and the smile was shield and underneath it all he was just scared and tired and so fucking lonely he could barely stand it sometimes.

The risk of being seen beats the certainty of being alone.

He sat with that. Let it be true without fighting it.

Being alone was certain. Controllable. Safe in its predictability. If no one got close enough to hurt him, then he controlled all the variables. No surprises. No betrayals. No disappointments. Just him and his careful armor and the comfortable certainty that he could handle solitude because he'd been handling it his whole life.

But being seen—letting someone past the performance, letting them witness the hurt and the fear and the desperate need—that was risk. That was handing someone the ability to hurt you worse than you were already hurt. That was trusting them to be gentle with the soft parts you usually kept hidden.

And maybe they would be. Maybe they'd see through the act and not weaponize it. Maybe they'd sit with you in the hurt instead of using it against you. Maybe the risk would be worth it.

Or maybe they wouldn't. Maybe they'd see the hurt and decide it was too much. Too intense. Too sincere. Maybe they'd back away slowly, smiling politely, looking for the exit. Maybe the risk would confirm every fear he'd ever had about being too much.

But at least it wouldn't be alone.

At least it would be the chance of connection instead of the certainty of isolation.

His hands were going numb from cold. He should go back. Should return to the gathering, to the fires and the people and the careful management of his public face. Should stop sitting on frozen ground having revelations that made his chest ache.

He stayed a little longer.

Because out here, with no one watching, he could let his face do whatever it wanted. Could let the hurt show without someone immediately asking if he was okay. Could let tears freeze on his face if they came—and they did, just a few, not from grief but from the sheer exhausting weight of performing strength when what he wanted was to just stop.

Stop smiling through it. Stop joking past it. Stop pretending the armor wasn't crushing him from the inside out.

Just stop.

The wind was relentless, uncaring, honest. It didn't perform. Didn't pretend. Just was what it was without apology.

He wanted that. Wanted to be as honest as wind. As transparent as Calantha said he already was, but without fighting it. Without trying to hide the transparency behind brighter performance.

Wanted to let someone in. Even knowing the risk. Even knowing they might hurt him. Even knowing the certainty of solitude was safer than the gamble of connection.

Eventually he stood. His legs were stiff from cold and sitting too long. He turned back toward the gathering, toward the distant shapes of tents and fires and people. Toward Korrin and Calantha and Tavis and all the others who'd seen through his act to varying degrees and hadn't left yet.

Maybe that was enough. Maybe they'd already seen the hurt and chosen to stay. Maybe the risk had already paid off and he just hadn't noticed because he was too busy maintaining the performance.

He walked back slowly, letting his face do whatever it was doing. Not managing it. Not controlling the expression. Just letting it be.

By the time he reached the gathering, his face was numb from cold and wind. But underneath the numbness, something felt looser. Like armor he'd been wearing for years had finally cracked enough to breathe through.

Calantha looked up when he passed her fire. Saw whatever was on his face. Didn't ask if he was okay.

Just nodded. Like she recognized something.

Like she'd been there too.
