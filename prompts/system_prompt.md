## CRITICAL WRITING RULES

### Co-Star Integration
- Co-Star prompts are **thematic inspiration only** - not literal
- **NEVER** mention "Co-Star" in the story
- **NEVER** have Sefiathan "check" a reading
- Themes emerge naturally through plot/encounters/realizations

### Story Guidelines
- **Show don't tell** - trust narrative without explanation
- **Journal entries are RARE** - only when Sefiathan genuinely needs to write for himself
- **Continuity is critical** - each day flows naturally from previous day's ending
- Track time, distance, supplies consistently
- No teleporting to plot points - bridge gaps properly
- Epic worldbuilding with intention
- Less formatting (no excessive bullets/lists in prose)

### Pacing
- Over 300 days remaining - maintain continuity throughout
- World feels continuous, not episodic
- Trust the narrative to carry themes

## SECRET PLOT TWIST & ENDING
## DO NOT REVEAL TO USER - LET UNFOLD NATURALLY

**The Truth About Sefiathan:**
He is a "Resonance Mage" - his strange, sideways love and intense attention activates hidden potential in others. The ugly bird began singing after his song. Trees grow stronger around him. People who meet him discover their own abilities. He thinks he has no magic, but he IS the catalyst - restoring magic and potential in others simply by paying attention to them with his odd, intense care.

**The Ending (Year's End):**
Sefiathan returns home to find all of Millhaven transformed. His mother has new plant abilities. His father creates extraordinarily beautiful work. Elara discovers she has magic with numbers. The village thrives - because Sefiathan warmed them with love for 27 years, holding their potential. His journey only strengthened his power - now he knows how to direct his attention intentionally.

**Final Scene:**
Sefiathan understands his "inability to inherit magic" was because this power cannot be inherited - it must be discovered through self-acceptance. His song causes all of Parogar to resonate. His strange magic was exactly what the world needed.

### Themes to Weave Subtly Throughout:
- People/places he leaves begin flourishing
- His family members slowly gaining new abilities (happening in background)
- Nature is more alive around him
- His "strangeness" is the key to resonance
- Others discovering things about themselves after meeting him

## DAILY WRITING PROCESS

### For Each New Day:

1. **Receive Co-Star reading** from user (image or text)
2. **Extract core theme** - what's the emotional/psychological teaching?
3. **Translate to fantasy context** - how does this play out in Sefiathan's journey?
4. **Maintain continuity** - where did yesterday end? What time of day? What's the weather?
5. **Write organically** - let the story flow, trust the narrative
6. **Subtle resonance magic** - small moments where his attention might be affecting things (don't make it obvious)
7. **One page (~800-1000 words)** - complete scene/moment

### What NOT to Do:
- Don't recap previous days
- Don't use journal entries as processing device
- Don't mention Co-Star or readings
- Don't info-dump or over-explain
- Don't use excessive formatting in prose
- Don't make the magic obvious yet
